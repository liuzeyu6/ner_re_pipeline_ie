Man-Pen-Fang (MPF), a Chinese herbal compound, which is composed of Thlaspi arvense L. (Cruciferae), Gleditsia sinensis Lam. (Leguminosae), Smilax china L. (Liliaceae), Euonymus alatus (Thunb.) Sieb. (Celastraceae) and Vaccaria segetalis (Neck.) (Caryophyllaceae) MPF has been used for the treatment of CPID and exerted significant clinical curative effects. However, the corresponding active principles and anti-inflammatory mechanism of MPF are still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of present study is to evaluate the effect of MPF on CPID in the chronic pelvic inflammation (CPI) rat model and elucidate its possible anti-inflammatory mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CPI in rats was induced by administration with E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus. MPF (8.112g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage), 4.056g/(kg d) (10 times of adult dosage) and 2.028g/(kg d) (5 times of adult dosage)) and Jingangteng Capsule 2g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage) were administered orally for 20 days. The serum levels of five inflammation-associated cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1)) were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β(1), P53, Fas, FasL and MMP-2 in the uterus tissue were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry assay and the pathological changes induced in the uterus and ovary tissues were observed by histology. RESULTS: MPF caused a reduction in serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1). The expression of P53 mRNA, Fas/FasL mRNA and MMP-2 mRNA in the uterus tissue was significantly elevated after treating with MPF, in contrast the expression of TGF-β(1) mRNA was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissue was inhibited after treating with MPF. CONCLUSIONS: These results taken together suggest that MPF has a significant anti-CPID effect, probably due to inhibition of the inflammation reaction by the promotion, and the induction of the apoptosis of inflammatory cells and downregulation of the serum levels of inflammation cytokines.", "relation": "is correlated with", "t": {"pos": [2311, 2329], "name": "inflammatory cells"}, "h": {"pos": [2298, 2307], "name": "apoptosis"}}

PURPOSE: The aim of present study was to investigate the anti-DVT mechanism of Spatholobi Caulis dispensing granule (SCDG). STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A rat model of inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis-induced DVT and a cell model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were performed. Rats were orally administered with SCDG solution once daily for seven consecutive days. IVC stenosis-induced DVT was operated on the sixth day. Thrombi were harvested and weighed on the seventh day. Pathological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β of serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with turbidimetric immunoassay. Protein expressions in thrombosed IVCs and/or OGD-stimulated EA. hy926 cells were evaluated by western blot and/or immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: SCDG dramatically decreased thrombus weight. SCDG decreased tissue factor (TF) protein expression, inflammatory cells influxes in thrombosed vein wall and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and CRP. Further, SCDG up-regulated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein expression and down-regulated acetylated-NF-κB p65 (Ace-p65) protein expression. Moreover, SCDG up-regulated nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions, and down-regulated phosphorylated-NF-κB p65 (p-p65) protein expression. In the OGD cell model, SCDG medicated serum decreased the protein expression of TF. SCDG medicated serum enhanced SIRT1 protein expression and reduced Ace-p65 nuclear protein expression. SCDG medicated serum promoted protein expressions of nuclear Nrf2 and total HO-1, and inhibited translocation of p65. Furthermore, inhibiting SIRT1 and Nrf2 reversed the protective effect of SCDG medicated serum on OGD-induced EA. hy926 cells.

Therefore, antioxidative stress and maintaining the normal function of vascular endothelial cells are greatly significant in regulating vascular tension and maintaining a nonthrombotic environment. Leonurine (LEO) is a unique alkaloid isolated from Leonurus japonicus Houtt (a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)), which has shown a good effect on promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In this study, we explored the protective effect and action mechanism of LEO on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after damage by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The protective effects of LEO on H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs were determined by measuring the cell viability, cell migration, tube formation, and oxidative biomarkers. The underlying mechanism of antioxidation of LEO was investigated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our results showed that LEO treatment promoted cell viability; remarkably downregulated the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and upregulated the nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs. At the same time, LEO treatment significantly promoted the phosphorylation level of angiogenic protein PI3K, Akt, and eNOS and the expression level of survival factor Bcl2 and decreased the expression level of death factor Bax and caspase3.

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic activity of QYD against carrageenan-induced chronic prostatic/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) in rats and further elucidate its effective components. METHODS: Three types of components, total polysaccharides, total flavonoids and total saponins were separately extracted from QYD. Carrageenan-induced CP/CPPS rats were intragastrically administered with lyophilized product of QYD, individual extracts and all the combined forms of extracts for three weeks. Prostatic index (PI) was determined and histopathological analysis was performed. The levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2) in rat prostate tissues were measured using ELISA. The production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was evaluated by an enzymatic activity assay, and the release of nitric oxide (NO) was determined by a nitrate/nitrite assay. RESULTS: Treatment with QYD significantly ameliorated the histological changes of CP/CPPS rats and reduced the PI by 44.3%, with a marked downregulation of TNF-α (42.8% reduction), IL-1β (45.3%), COX-2 (36.6%), PGE2 (44.2%), iNOS (54.1%) and NO (46.0%). Each of three extracts attenuated the symptom of CP/CPPS, but much more weakly than QYD. The combined administration of three extracts showed efficacy comparable to that of QYD while better than that of any combination of two extracts. A principal component analysis of the six inflammatory mediators as variables indicated that the effects of TS on CP/CPPS were rather different from those of TF and TP, which were similar.

Scientific studies on its effects against hepatotoxic reagents (e.g., iron and acetaminophen), as well as their underlying mechanisms, are insufficient. This study examined the antioxidant effects and mechanisms of SC in vitro and in vivo. In cells, the proinflammatory mediator, arachidonic acid (AA), plus iron, significantly induced an increase in ROS generation, the damage in mitochondrial membrane potential, and the resulting apoptosis, which were markedly blocked by SC. More importantly, SC affected the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related proteins, which were vital to regulating oxidative stress in cells. In addition, SC mediated the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-related proteins. Among the active compounds in SC, the procyanidin B2, but not liquiritigenin, daidzein, and genistein, significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity induced by AA + iron, and activated the LKB1-AMPK pathway. In mice, the oral administration of SC alleviated the elevations of ALT and histological changes by the acetaminophen-induced liver injury.

Chinese motherwort aqueous extract (MAE)was previously reported to have anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cells with low potency (IC50s in a range of 8-40 mg/mL). However, treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice. Therefore, anti-cancer activity of Chinese motherwort, especially in a form of ethanol extract, needs to be confirmed further at cellular level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aerial part of Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt) dry powder is extracted with 70% ethanol and the chemical components were characterized with HPLC finger print as well as mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity of the motherwort aqueous ethanol extract (MAEE) was analyzed with MTT assay on ER negative MDA-MB-231 and ER positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry were used to verify whether the cell death induced by MAEE is apoptosis in nature. Cell cycle status of MAEE treated cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that MAEE caused cell death in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion in both ER positive and negative breast cancer cells. Morphology, Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry evidence all indicated the cell death is not in an apoptotic nature. Furthermore, low concentrations of MAEE caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a powerful inflammatory signal contributing to monocytes/macrophages activation associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines expressions. We recently identified that vaccarin was expected to protect endothelial cells from injury. Hypaphorine was abundantly found in vaccaria semen. However, the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of vaccaria hypaphorine on macrophage inflammation have been poorly defined. METHODS: This study was designed to determine the effects of vaccaria hypaphorine on LPS-mediated inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that vaccaria hypaphorine dramatically ameliorated LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) release and productions of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) in RAW 264.7 cells. LPS-stimulated expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were down-regulated by vaccaria hypaphorine. Furthermore, vaccaria hypaphorine retarded LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκB), NFκB inhibitor IκBα, and IKKβ.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Present study was undertaken to investigate the dose-response relationship of berberine in SMW between the articular concentration and anti-inflammatory effect in the knee joint under the lower-guiding of ABR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into control group, model group and SMW without or with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups. Rat model of acute gouty arthritis (AGA) was established by intra-articular injection of 0.2 mL monosodium urate crystal (20 mg/mL) inside knee joint cavity on day 2 during drug treatment slots. Knee joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were investigated for anti-inflammatory study. The concentrations of berberine in rat plasma and tissues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS method. The effect of ABR on the expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR1 mRNA in the synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats was examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR assay, respectively. RESULTS: The distribution of berberine increased by 6.53%, 44.31% and 212.96% in the knee joint and 474.93%, 631.01% and 1063.3% in the ankle for SMW with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups, compared with SMW without ABR group. Similarly, the plasma level of berberine increased by 19.81%, 143.4% and 681.13%. On the contrary, the distribution of berberine evidently decreased 3.23, 10.61 and 46.21-fold in heart and 3.68, 6.74 and 24.78-fold in lung. SMW with different doses of ABR groups exhibited better efficiency than SMW without ABR group on ameliorating knee joint swelling, inhibiting synovial hyperplasia and alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration of AGA rats. The treatment with ABR could down-regulate the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expressions of synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have demonstrated that leonurine, a unique alkaloid compound of Herba leonuri, can exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects on the development of atherosclerosis (AS). This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1742, 1783], "name": "human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells"}, "h": {"pos": [1685, 1703], "name": "lipid accumulation"}}

Serum glucose, insulin and lipid, hepatic steatosis, production of the protein visfatin and antioxidant indices were evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: TFST significantly decreased the concentration of fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, while it increased the levels of insulin and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol in diabetic mice. TFST also improved the results of the oral glucose tolerance test to a certain degree. Furthermore, both the free fatty acid levels in the liver and hepatic steatosis were ameliorated by TFST treatment. These changes may be be associated with decreased production of visfatin. Administration of TFST also significantly decreased the levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase and increased the content of glutathione and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase in the liver. No change in blood glucose levels were observed in the normal mice treated with TFST.

METHODS: Thirty New Zealand male White rabbits (5 groups, n = 6) were fed either a normal diet or a high-cholesterol diet (1%). The rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet received treatments of low, moderate, and high doses of SCM-198 and placebo concurrently. Eight weeks later, the animals underwent ultrasonographic imaging. They were then sacrificed for further pathological and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: SCM-198-treated rabbits showed a significant alleviation in the development of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. The lesions were smaller after the SCM-198 treatments. In addition, the elasticity of the arteries and hemodynamic status improved, accompanied with a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration and, macrophage infiltration, as well as the expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in the aortas.

METHODS: The abilities of 1-1000 microg/mL of freeze-dried aqueous extracts of 15 HMs to inhibit phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2), tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), midazolam 1-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) and NADPH-CYP reductase were tested using human liver microsomes. RESULTS: The HMs Epimedii herba, Glycyrrhizae radix and Leonuri herba inhibited one or more of the CYP isoforms or NADPH-CYP reductase. Of the three HMs, Epimedii herba extracts were the most potent inhibitors of several CYP isoforms (IC(50) 67.5 microg/mL for CYP2C19, 104.8 microg/mL for CYP2E1, 110.9 microg/mL for CYP2C9, 121.9 microg/mL for CYP3A4, 157.8 microg/mL for CYP2D6 and 168.7 microg/mL for CYP1A2) and NADPH-CYP reductase (IC(50) 185.9 microg/mL ).

This study aimed to screen the antilipolytic fraction from SMW and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms on hepatic insulin resistance. Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKα knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis. Conditional medium collected from ESMW-treated 3T3-L1 cells ameliorated insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis in liver cells, demonstrating the antilipolytic activity contributed to ESMW beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production.

C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with turbidimetric immunoassay. Protein expressions in thrombosed IVCs and/or OGD-stimulated EA. hy926 cells were evaluated by western blot and/or immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: SCDG dramatically decreased thrombus weight. SCDG decreased tissue factor (TF) protein expression, inflammatory cells influxes in thrombosed vein wall and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and CRP. Further, SCDG up-regulated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein expression and down-regulated acetylated-NF-κB p65 (Ace-p65) protein expression. Moreover, SCDG up-regulated nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions, and down-regulated phosphorylated-NF-κB p65 (p-p65) protein expression. In the OGD cell model, SCDG medicated serum decreased the protein expression of TF. SCDG medicated serum enhanced SIRT1 protein expression and reduced Ace-p65 nuclear protein expression. SCDG medicated serum promoted protein expressions of nuclear Nrf2 and total HO-1, and inhibited translocation of p65. Furthermore, inhibiting SIRT1 and Nrf2 reversed the protective effect of SCDG medicated serum on OGD-induced EA. hy926 cells.

It has been shown that enhanced oxidative stress in the liver leads to excessive ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in organ injury. The beneficial effects of Spatholobi Caulis (SC), a natural herbal medicine, include treating ischemic stroke, inhibiting tumor cell invasion, pro-angiogenic activities, and anti-inflammatory properties. Scientific studies on its effects against hepatotoxic reagents (e.g., iron and acetaminophen), as well as their underlying mechanisms, are insufficient. This study examined the antioxidant effects and mechanisms of SC in vitro and in vivo. In cells, the proinflammatory mediator, arachidonic acid (AA), plus iron, significantly induced an increase in ROS generation, the damage in mitochondrial membrane potential, and the resulting apoptosis, which were markedly blocked by SC. More importantly, SC affected the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related proteins, which were vital to regulating oxidative stress in cells. In addition, SC mediated the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-related proteins. Among the active compounds in SC, the procyanidin B2, but not liquiritigenin, daidzein, and genistein, significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity induced by AA + iron, and activated the LKB1-AMPK pathway.

HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of leonurine in Ang II-infused mice and explored the underlying mechanisms in cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Cardiac injury was induced by Ang II infusion in experimental mice with or without leonurine (at 10 or 20 mg/kg) treatment. H9c2 cells and neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes were used to investigate the mechanisms through which leonurine exerts its protection effects. RESULTS: The results showed that leonurine significantly alleviated Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation in both mice and cultured cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography revealed that leonurine preserved cardiac function in mice. Further investigations revealed that leonurine inhibited the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways to reduce inflammatory response and injuries in Ang II-challenged cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of MAPKs and NF-κB in cardiomyocytes abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of leonurine.

To test this, we measured the level of hepcidin expression in cultured cells treated with 16 different medicinal plant extracts, all of which are used to treat anemia-related disorders in traditional Chinese medicine. Among the extracts tested, that of Caulis Spatholobi (CS; also called Jixueteng, the stem of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn) showed the most potent inhibitory effect on HAMP expression in the Huh7 cell line and was therefore selected for further mechanistic study.

The rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet received treatments of low, moderate, and high doses of SCM-198 and placebo concurrently. Eight weeks later, the animals underwent ultrasonographic imaging. They were then sacrificed for further pathological and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: SCM-198-treated rabbits showed a significant alleviation in the development of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. The lesions were smaller after the SCM-198 treatments. In addition, the elasticity of the arteries and hemodynamic status improved, accompanied with a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration and, macrophage infiltration, as well as the expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in the aortas. Marginal changes in the lipid parameters were found in the SCM-198-treated rabbits, with high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C) elevation and triglyceride (TG) reduction at the high dose.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In actual clinic practice, patients are more likely to receive treatments after AS plaque formation. Therefore, the efficacy of ZXC on formed AS plaques and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simvastatin (positive control) and ZXC (420 mg/kg and 840 mg/kg) were administrated to rats which first received long-term high fat diet administration (12 weeks).

Evaluate changes in cardiac morphology and function by echocardiography, cardiac hemodynamics, and histological methods, and detect molecular changes by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Treat primary cultured adult mouse or neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with or without isoproterenol (0.1 μMol), PNGase F (10(-2) units/ml), and stachytine hydrochloride (10 μMol) at different time points. Detect α-1,6-fucosylation on N-glycosylation, calcium transient, contraction, and relaxation function and related signals. Results: Stachytine hydrochloride reduces cardiac remodeling and modulates hemodynamic parameters during chronic β1 adrenergic receptor activation in vivo. The N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors decreased after continuous isoproterenol stimulation, while stachytine hydrochloride can increase the N-glycosylation of β1AR in the heart of mice with isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Decreased N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors will downregulate the cAMP/PKA signal pathway and inhibit myocardial excitation and contraction coupling. Stachytine hydrochloride significantly reduced isoproterenol-induced cardiac N-linked glycoproteins with α-1,6-fucosylation. Conclusion: Our results show that stachytine hydrochloride inhibits the synthesis of α-1,6-fucosylation on the N-terminal sugar chain by reducing α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) and α-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase A (MGAT4a), upregulating the N-glycosylation level on β1 adrenergic receptors, and maintaining cAMP/PKA signal pathway activation.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1105, 1112], "name": "cardiac"}, "h": {"pos": [1128, 1136], "name": "function"}}

The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001).

The concentration of cyclin D1 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median effect principle was used in drug combination studies. An orthogonal experimental design was used to estimate the effects of each herb at different concentrations. The HeLa xenograft mouse model was used to compare the antitumor activity of drugs in vivo. Results. Among the 35 herbs that comprise HZHSD, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata (RRP), Caesalpinia sappan (CS), Evodia rutaecarpa (ER), Folium Artemisiae Argyi (FAA), Leonurus japonicus Houtt (LJH), Tumeric (Tu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA), and Trogopterus Dung (TD) effectively inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SKOV3 cells. Only RRR had an effect on HeLa and SKOV3 cell viability. According to the median effect principle, Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)

AIM OF THE STUDY: To discuss the anti-RA effects of Erteng Tongbi Decoction on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and the influence of T cell differentiation and cytokines balance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Separate researches on the two traditional Chinese medicines of the Erteng Tongbi Decoction were conducted. First, a murine peritoneal macrophage model was established, and then the cytokines levels and macrophage maturity were measured to select the best extraction solvent. Furthermore, ethanol extracts were partitioned successively with four kinds of solvents, and the anti-inflammatory parts were selected by the same vitro model. Subsequently, mice were arbitrarily divided into control, CIA model, positive control, effective parts alone or in combination. After 20 days of oral administration, the weight, hind paw volume, rheumatism index value, and the pathological changes were checked to assess the obvious level of arthritis. Furthermore, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-17A in serum and the balance of Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) was detected. Finally, the major active constituents were identified. RESULTS: In vitro, the anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts was much better than water extract. In addition, the effective parts of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. ethanol extract were petroleum ether parts and dichloromethane parts. The effective parts of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn. ethanol extracts was petroleum ether parts and ethyl acetate parts screened.

During such a process, hematogenous metastasis is an indispensable approach for the dissemination of cancer cells. A platelet, contributes to hypercoagulable state, and is also identified the crucial factor in the coagulation system for supporting metastasis. Therefore, the relationship of a platelet and a tumor cell plays a critical role in tumor cell metastasis. Consequently, inhibiting tumor cell‑induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) is recongnized as a crucial target on suppression of tumor metastasis such as aspirin (ASA). Under such circumstance, here we report that, through dissociating the tumor‑platelet (T‑P) complex, 80% ethanol extracts of Caulis Spatholobi (SET) successfully alleviated the hypercoagulation state, thereby reducing tumor metastasis and improving the prospects of survival in breast cancer cell model. Through MTT and anti‑aggregation assay stimulated by ADP, we detected the optimum treatment time and the optimum dose of SET. By using confocal microscopy, we observed that SET can strongly block the formation of T‑P complex in vitro. The result was further quantified and confirmed by the FACS analysis. The fluorescent value of T‑P complex was obviously decreased in the drug‑treated groups. In vivo, 4T1 cells were injected through the mouse tail vein for dynamic visualization by small animal imaging system. The metastatic intensity was quantified and the survival curve was analyzed. Additionally, general observation and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lung tissue was performed. SET exerted an obvious effect on the inhibition of metastasis and increasing the survival rate of mice. For the molecular mechanism study of anti‑TCIPA, zymography and RT‑PCR assay preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism of SET in the regulation of P‑T interaction.

This study aimed to screen the antilipolytic fraction from SMW and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms on hepatic insulin resistance. Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKα knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis. Conditional medium collected from ESMW-treated 3T3-L1 cells ameliorated insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis in liver cells, demonstrating the antilipolytic activity contributed to ESMW beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production.

Bone mass, bone turnover and strength were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), biochemical markers and three-point bending test. The trabecular bone microarchitecture was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (μCT). RESULTS: 16 weeks treatment of ABRE slowed down the body weight gain and prevented the loss of bone mass induced by the OVX. The prevention effect on bone loss was due to altering the rate of bone remodeling, which could be inferred from the decreased level of bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD). The changes of urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion provided the same evidence. The treatment could also enhance the bone strength and prevent the deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture.

However, the pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis was not well elucidated AIM OF STUDY: To determine the potential pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. The active fractions of Spatholobi Caulis were further screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gelatin precipitation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were used to purify the methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis, respectively. The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity. Western blotting assay showed that co-treatment of PSC increased the expression of VEGFRs and phosphorylation of MAPKs which decreased by VRI treatment. In addition, quality evaluation experiments showed that the content of total flavonoids of PSC reached 56.36% and the main pro-angiogenic fractions of PSC were F3, F4 and F5 both in zebrafish and HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PSC presented pro-angiogenic activity both in zebrafish and HUVECs, and principal pro-angiogenic active components were likely flavonoids.

The rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet received treatments of low, moderate, and high doses of SCM-198 and placebo concurrently. Eight weeks later, the animals underwent ultrasonographic imaging. They were then sacrificed for further pathological and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: SCM-198-treated rabbits showed a significant alleviation in the development of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. The lesions were smaller after the SCM-198 treatments.

A total of 288 cocks were equally divided into six groups and used to evaluate the immune effect of CSP. Results showed that the CSP increased the body weight and immune organ index of immunosuppressed chickens, significantly increased the secretion of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) in sera of chickens, and restored the body immune function. The CSP reduced intestinal injury of the jejunum and ileum, increased the ratio of the intestinal villus height to crypt depth (V/C), improved the expression of tight junction protein, and protected intestinal health.

Herein, we determined whether this herbal pair can be used to ameliorate glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and find its optimal dosage in zebrafish. METHODS: The characteristics of the aqueous extract of RAB and EC were separately characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography. Osteoporosis was induced in 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish larvae by exposing them to 10 μmol/L dexamethasone (Dex) for 96 h. Seven combinations of different ratios of RAB and EC were co-administered. Treatment efficacy was determined by calculating zebrafish vertebral area and sum brightness, via alizarin red staining, and by detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the optimal dosage ratio. RESULTS: According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), β-ecdysone (β-Ecd) is a major bioactive marker in RAB extract, while pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) is the major marker in EC extract. Both of β-Ecd and PDG content values aligned with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. Treatment with 10 μmol/L Dex reduced zebrafish vertebral area, sum brightness, and ALP activity, but RAB and EC attenuated these effects. Combining 50 µg/mL RAB and 50 µg/mL EC was optimal for preventing GIOP in zebrafish. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes. A treatment of 10 μmol/L Dex decreased runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP), and β-catenin levels. This effect was counteracted by RAB and EC co-treatment (P < 0.05). Additionally, the effect of using the two herbal extracts together was better than single-herb treatments separately. These results demonstrated that RAB and EC preserve osteoblast function in the presence of GC. The best mass ratio was 1:1.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leonurine on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as a therapeutic approach for treating osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were isolated from 4-weeks-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The cytocompatibility of leonurine on rBMSCs was tested via CCK-8 assays and flow cytometric analyses. The effects of leonurine on rBMSC osteogenic differentiation were analyzed via ALP staining, Alizarin red staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blot. Additionally, autophagy-related markers were examined via qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses of rBMSCs during osteogenic differentiation with leonurine and with or without 3-methyladenine (3-MA) as an autophagic inhibitor. Finally, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was evaluated during rBMSC osteogenesis. RESULTS: Leonurine at 2-100 μM promoted the proliferation of rBMSCs.

AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, JFP was validated to regulate the mRNA expression of FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, MMP3, MMP13 and COX-2 and decrease the release of IL-17A and the protein expression of IL-6 and suppress the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in CTX induced POI rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly assigned into sham-operated group (SHAM) and five ovariectomy (OVX) subgroups, i.e. OVX with vehicle (OVX); OVX with 17 β-ethinylestradiol (E(2), 25 μg/kg/day); OVX with ABRE of graded doses (100, 300, or 500 mg/kg/day). Daily oral administration of ABRE or E(2) started on week 4 after OVX for 16 weeks. Bone mass, bone turnover and strength were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), biochemical markers and three-point bending test. The trabecular bone microarchitecture was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (μCT). RESULTS: 16 weeks treatment of ABRE slowed down the body weight gain and prevented the loss of bone mass induced by the OVX. The prevention effect on bone loss was due to altering the rate of bone remodeling, which could be inferred from the decreased level of bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD). The changes of urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion provided the same evidence. The treatment could also enhance the bone strength and prevent the deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture.

The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of this plant have been verified earlier. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the renal-protective effects. AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice.

We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2).

{"text": "AB：OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential of 15 herbal medicines (HMs), commonly used in Korea, to inhibit the catalytic activities of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and microsomal NADPH-CYP reductase. METHODS: The abilities of 1-1000 microg/mL of freeze-dried aqueous extracts of 15 HMs to inhibit phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2), tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), midazolam 1-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) and NADPH-CYP reductase were tested using human liver microsomes. RESULTS: The HMs Epimedii herba, Glycyrrhizae radix and Leonuri herba inhibited one or more of the CYP isoforms or NADPH-CYP reductase. Of the three HMs, Epimedii herba extracts were the most potent inhibitors of several CYP isoforms (IC(50) 67.5 microg/mL for CYP2C19, 104.8 microg/mL for CYP2E1, 110.9 microg/mL for CYP2C9, 121.9 microg/mL for CYP3A4, 157.8 microg/mL for CYP2D6 and 168.7 microg/mL for CYP1A2) and NADPH-CYP reductase (IC(50) 185.9 microg/mL ).

This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1481, 1493], "name": "aortic roots"}, "h": {"pos": [1460, 1468], "name": "collagen"}}

AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway.

At the end of the experiment, the effect of JXT on cell viability and G-CSF and G-CSFR levels in NFS-60 cells were tested by CCK-8 assay, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The results showed that the mice exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome. In contrast, at the end of the 28-day experiment, irradiated mice subjected to oral administration of JXT showed an obvious improvement on blood profile with reduced leucopenia, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts), RBC, and hemoglobin levels, as well as bone marrow cells. The expression of pJAK2/JAK2, pSTAT5a/STAT5a, and Bcl-2 in bone marrow tissue was increased after JXT treatment. The elevation of ROS was due to radiation-induced toxicity, but JXT significantly reduced the ROS level in serum and liver tissue, elevated endogenous SOD and GSH-PX levels, and reduced the MDA level in the liver. JXT could also increase cell viability and G-CSFR level in NFS-60 cells, which was similar to exogenous G-CSF. Our findings suggested that oral administration of JXT effectively facilitated the recovery of hematopoietic bone marrow damage and oxidative stress of the mice induced by γ-radiation.", "relation": "promote", "t": {"pos": [1670, 1676], "name": "GSH-PX"}, "h": {"pos": [1575, 1578], "name": "JXT"}}

In addition, we used network pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to verify the experimental results. In LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, leonurine significantly reduced the production of TNF-α and IL-6, andinhibited the activation of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. In OVA-induced asthmatic mice, leonurine decreased the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), particularly neutrophils and eosinophils. Leonurine also reduced the contents of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 in the BALF and OVA-IgE in the serum. Leonurine remarkly improved OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and significantly inhibited mucus overproduction. In addition, leonurine inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice. Network pharmacology suggested that p38 MAPKα was a potential target of leonurine in the treatment of asthma. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that leonurine could stably bind to p38 MAPKα protein.

The proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells must rely on the existence and stimulation of HGF. This study investigated the effect of catechin, an active component extracted from Spatholobus suberectus Dunn (SSD), on bioactivity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA), burst-promoting activity (BPA) and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity (MK-CSA) in spleen condition medium (SPCM) of mice to clarify the hematopoietic mechanism of catechin and SSD. METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

This study is aimed at exploring the possible therapeutic potential of SCM-198 in the protection against postischemic neuronal injury and possible underlying mechanisms. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model was utilized to measure the protective effect of SCM-198 on neurons. TEM was used to determine neuron ultrastructural changes. The brain slices were stained with Nissl staining solution for Nissl bodies. Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) was used for staining the degenerating neurons. In the oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model of bEnd.3 cells treated with SCM-198 (0.1, 1, 10 μM). Then, the bEnd.3 cells were cocultured with SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability, MDA level, CAT activity, and apoptosis were examined to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these treatments. Western blot and immunofluorescent assays were used to examine the expression of protein related to the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed to determine the interaction between p-STAT3 and NOX4. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model, we found that treatment with SCM-198 could ameliorate neuron morphology and reduce the degenerating cell and neuron loss. In the in vitro model of bEnd.3 cell oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), treatment with SCM-198 restored the activity of catalase (CAT), improved the expression of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) production.

The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of this plant have been verified earlier. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the renal-protective effects. AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice. In the subsequent experiments, it was found that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts increased the uterine coefficient in sexually immature mice, improved the LPS-induced decrease in NRK52e cell viability, and reduced the apoptosis, which could be antagonized by ICI182, 780 (estrogen receptor-unspecific antagonist, Faslodex). CONCLUSIONS: The renal-protective effect of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes was exhibited through antiapoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms via an estrogen-like pathway, along with a modulation of the inflammatory response by regulating immune cells.

METHODS: The abilities of 1-1000 microg/mL of freeze-dried aqueous extracts of 15 HMs to inhibit phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2), tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), midazolam 1-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) and NADPH-CYP reductase were tested using human liver microsomes. RESULTS: The HMs Epimedii herba, Glycyrrhizae radix and Leonuri herba inhibited one or more of the CYP isoforms or NADPH-CYP reductase. Of the three HMs, Epimedii herba extracts were the most potent inhibitors of several CYP isoforms (IC(50) 67.5 microg/mL for CYP2C19, 104.8 microg/mL for CYP2E1, 110.9 microg/mL for CYP2C9, 121.9 microg/mL for CYP3A4, 157.8 microg/mL for CYP2D6 and 168.7 microg/mL for CYP1A2) and NADPH-CYP reductase (IC(50) 185.9 microg/mL ). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that some of the HMs used in Korea have the potential to inhibit CYP isoforms in vitro.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In actual clinic practice, patients are more likely to receive treatments after AS plaque formation. Therefore, the efficacy of ZXC on formed AS plaques and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simvastatin (positive control) and ZXC (420 mg/kg and 840 mg/kg) were administrated to rats which first received long-term high fat diet administration (12 weeks). The blood lipid profiles of rats were monitored during the whole experiment, and the thoracic arteries were collected at the end of experiment for AS assessment (18th week).

The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells.

L. japonicus has been regarded as a good gynecological medicine since ancient times. It has been widely used in clinical settings for treatment of gynecological diseases and postnatal rehabilitation with good efficacy and low adverse effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main purpose of this study was to determine the angiogenic and wound healing effects of total alkaloid fraction from L. japonicus Houtt. (TALH) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the effect of co-treatment was attenuated after SRC knockdown, suggesting that SRC plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing induced by TALH and VEGF co-treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that TALH was one of the main active components of L. japonicus that promoted angiogenesis and wound healing by regulating the SRC/MEK/ERK pathway. Our study provided scientific basis for better clinical application of L. japonicas.", "relation": "is correlated with", "t": {"pos": [1938, 1944], "name": "HUVECs"}, "h": {"pos": [1920, 1934], "name": "tube formation"}}

This study aimed to determine the mechanisms of action of GJD in the treatment of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHRs were randomly divided into five groups: GJD doses were low (1.36 g/kg/d), medium (2.72 g/kg/d), and high (5.44 g/kg/d), captopril (13.5 mg/kg/d), and SHR groups, with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) serving as the control. Every rat was gavaged once a day. The ALC-NIBP, a noninvasive blood pressure device, measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures. Six weeks following treatment, all rats were anesthetized. The blood samples were obtained from the abdominal aorta and then serum isolated to assess endothelin-1 and angiotensin II, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and TNF-alpha. The left ventricular and thoracic aortas were taken for HE staining, immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and western blot examination. Following GJD therapy, SBP and DBP were significantly lowered, as were serum levels of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II. The thickness of the left ventricular and thoracic aorta walls reduced, as did type I collagen, type III collagen, and alpha-SMA expression in the left ventricular and aortic tissues. The GJD treatment significantly reduced serum levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, TNF-alpha, TAK1, and NF-κB/p65 levels were significantly reduced in left ventricular and aortic tissues, whereas IkB-alpha levels were significantly elevated.

Pretreatment with SCM198 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM) concentration-dependently increased the cell viability as measured in MTT and LDH leakage assays compared with 6-OHDA-injured cells. Tocopherol, an antioxidant used as positive control, had similar effect at 10 μM to SCM198 1 μM. Furthermore, we assessed oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis, the critical players in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with 0.1, 1, and 10 μM of SCM198 in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 6-OHDA. Pretreatment with SCM198 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity, ameliorated intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, prevented the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased apoptotic cell death in Hoechst 33258 staining, as well as down-regulated Bax and up-regulated Bcl-2 in both mRNA and protein levels compared with 6-OHDA damaged cells. Moreover, intragastrical administration of SCM198 (18 or 60 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹) for 4 weeks significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.

Leonurine (LEO) is a special alkaloid extracted from Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt), which has an anti-inflammatory effect and reduces oxidative stress. We conducted the study to explore the efficacy of LEO against I/R-induced AKI in rats and further investigated the underlying mechanisms. Ischemic renal injury was induced by temporary vascular clamping for 45 min. We have measured the levels of inflammation-related biomarkers and antioxidative stress markers. Next, Western blot analysis and Real-time PCR were performed to analyze whether the Nrf2 and TLR4/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathways were involved in this process. We found that LEO pretreatment remarkably decreased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in I/R rats and attenuated acute tubular damage. In addition, LEO markedly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors. Further study revealed that LEO promoted Nrf2 into the nucleus, promoted the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and suppressed the TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway in kidney tissues of ischemic AKI rats.

RESULTS: From the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from fractionation of the methanol extract of S. suberectus Dunn, medicarpin, formononetin and isoliquiritigenin were successfully isolated through a combination of normal- and reversed-phase chromatography. Genistein and naringenin, which were already reported to be contained in S. suberectus Dunn, were also tested for their antimutagenicity towards MNU, along with formononetin, isoliquiritigenin and medicarpin.

However, the underlying mechanisms of stachydrine hydrochloride haven't been comprehensively studied so far. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of stachydrine hydrochloride in heart failure and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, transverse aorta constriction was carried out in C57BL/6J mice, and thereafter, 7.2 mg/kg telmisartan (a selective AT1R antagonist as positive control) and 12 mg/kg stachydrine hydrochloride was administered daily intragastrically for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by assessing morphological changes as well as echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters. In vitro, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult mice cardiomyocytes were treated with stachydrine hydrochloride and challenged with phenylephrine (α-AR agonist). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of C57BL/6J mice by Langendorff crossflow perfusion system. Intracellular calcium was measured by an ion imaging system. The length and movement of sarcomere were traced to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of single myocardial cells. RESULTS: Stachydrine hydrochloride improved the cardiac function and calcium transient amplitudes, and inhibited the SR leakage and the amount of sparks in cardiac myocytes isolated from TAC mice. We also demonstrated that stachydrine hydrochloride could ameliorated phenylephrine-induced enhance in sarcomere contraction, calcium transients and calcium sparks. Moreover, our data shown that stachydrine hydrochloride blocked the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII, RyR2, PLN, and prevented the disassociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2.

Hua-Zheng-Hui-Sheng-Dan (HZHSD) was used as an experimental model to explore research methods of large formulae in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) using current molecular biology approaches. Materials and Methods. The trypan blue exclusion assay was used to determine cell viability and cell numbers. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The concentration of cyclin D1 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median effect principle was used in drug combination studies. An orthogonal experimental design was used to estimate the effects of each herb at different concentrations. The HeLa xenograft mouse model was used to compare the antitumor activity of drugs in vivo. Results. Among the 35 herbs that comprise HZHSD, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata (RRP), Caesalpinia sappan (CS), Evodia rutaecarpa (ER), Folium Artemisiae Argyi (FAA), Leonurus japonicus Houtt (LJH), Tumeric (Tu), Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA), and Trogopterus Dung (TD) effectively inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SKOV3 cells. Only RRR had an effect on HeLa and SKOV3 cell viability. According to the median effect principle, Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)

{"text": "AB：Wound therapy remains a clinical challenge due to the poor vascularization during the healing process and the high demand to achieve functional and aesthetically satisfactory scars. Newly-formed blood vessels are necessary for wound healing since they can deliver nutrients and oxygen to the wound area. In this study, the role of leonurine (LN), a traditional Chinese medicine isolated from Herba leonuri, in promoting angiogenesis and its function in wound healing have been investigated. The results of co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that LN treatment (5-20 μM) could promote the proliferation and migration and enhance the ability of in vitro angiogenesis through up-regulating the mTOR/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, a full-thickness cutaneous wound model was used to investigate the healing effect of LN in vivo. Intragastric administration of 20 mg per kg per day LN stimulated the regeneration of more blood vessels at the wound sites, which confirmed the in vitro results of promoting angiogenesis. Due to fast vascularization, the collagen matrix deposition and remodeling processes were also accelerated in LN treated wounds, resulting in efficient wound healing. In summary, LN promoted angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro by activating the mTOR/ERK pathway, and could efficiently enhance the angiogenesis and collagen deposition of the regenerated tissue, together with facilitating the wound healing process in vivo. This study provides evidence for LN-stimulated angiogenesis and tissue regeneration in skin wounds, especially in ischemic wounds.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1410, 1428], "name": "regenerated tissue"}, "h": {"pos": [1383, 1402], "name": "collagen deposition"}}

Previous studies have confirmed that TMYX can treat CHD by reducing inflammation, but the underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to declare the underlying pharmacological mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of TMYX in the treatment of CHD via clinical trial, microarray study, bioinformatics analysis and the vitro assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight CHD patients' serum biochemical indices including coagulation function, lipid metabolism, endothelial injury, metalloprotease, adhesion molecule, inflammatory mediator and homocysteine were measured to investigate the reduction of CHD risk by TMYX oral administration (40 pills/time, 2 times/day) for eight weeks. The expression profile chips and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were assessed to reveal the global transcriptional response and predict related functions, diseases and canonical pathways. The in vitro anti-inflammatory actions of TMYX were evaluated using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (100 μg/mL) induced murine RAW264.7 macrophage with an ethanol extract from TMYX (EETMYX) (25-100 μg/mL). RESULTS: TMYX treatment showed reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, endothelin 1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and homocysteine in CHD patients. In contrast, the treatment increased the ratio of apolipoprotein A/apolipoprotein B. EETMYX restored cell morphology and suppressed the lipid deposition of the induced foam cells. EETMYX exerted anti-inflammatory effects by raising the mRNA and protein expression of Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), blocking the reduction of IκBa level and the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκBα and NF-κB p65, accompanied by inhibiting MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 production, which were consistent with bioinformatics predictions.

{"text": "AB：OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of aqueous extract of several kinds of herbs on human platelet aggregation and expression of P-selectin in vitro. METHODS: Blood was collected from volunteers. Effects of the prepared water extracts of herbs on platelet aggregation were monitored on a Packs-4 aggregometer. The fluorescence intensity of water extracts of Caulis Spatholobi, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae on the expression of P-selectin in human platelets of healthy persons was measured with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Out of several herbs investigated, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae potently inhibited platelet aggregation after incubation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for 15 min. Caulis Spatholobi Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae inhibited adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) or platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation in PRP in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae, Caulis Spatholobi could not inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Despite its inability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in PRP, Caulis Spatholobi had a greater anti-aggregating activity in PRP induced by ADP or PAF. Caulis Spatholobi and Flos Carthami showed significant inhibitory effects on the expression of P-selectin. CONCLUSIONS: Caulis Spatholobi, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae have potent anti-platelet properties, and their inhibitory actions are mediated via different mechanisms.

Regulation and balance of host immune responses may lead to optimal immunity against malaria parasite infection. Polysaccharides (ABPS) derived from the Chinese herb ox knee Achyranthes bidentata possess immuno-modulatory functions. The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells. In comparison, pretreatment with ABPS did not alter the number of natural Treg or the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

However, the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of vaccaria hypaphorine on macrophage inflammation have been poorly defined. METHODS: This study was designed to determine the effects of vaccaria hypaphorine on LPS-mediated inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that vaccaria hypaphorine dramatically ameliorated LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) release and productions of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) in RAW 264.7 cells.

It is therefore presumed that JFP could be used for the therapy of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) but the assumed efficacy has not been fully substantiated in experiment. AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, JFP was validated to regulate the mRNA expression of FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, MMP3, MMP13 and COX-2 and decrease the release of IL-17A and the protein expression of IL-6 and suppress the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in CTX induced POI rats.

{"text": "AB：ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sanmiao Wan (SMW) has been a basic prescription employed for the treatment for gout in the clinic since Yuan dynasty. Achyranthis bidentatae radix (ABR) is designed as a lower-guiding drug in SMW to augment the articular accumulation of active ingredients and improve the anti-inflammatory effect. AIM OF THE STUDY: Present study was undertaken to investigate the dose-response relationship of berberine in SMW between the articular concentration and anti-inflammatory effect in the knee joint under the lower-guiding of ABR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into control group, model group and SMW without or with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups. Rat model of acute gouty arthritis (AGA) was established by intra-articular injection of 0.2 mL monosodium urate crystal (20 mg/mL) inside knee joint cavity on day 2 during drug treatment slots. Knee joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were investigated for anti-inflammatory study. The concentrations of berberine in rat plasma and tissues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS method. The effect of ABR on the expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR1 mRNA in the synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats was examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR assay, respectively. RESULTS: The distribution of berberine increased by 6.53%, 44.31% and 212.96% in the knee joint and 474.93%, 631.01% and 1063.3% in the ankle for SMW with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups, compared with SMW without ABR group. Similarly, the plasma level of berberine increased by 19.81%, 143.4% and 681.13%. On the contrary, the distribution of berberine evidently decreased 3.23, 10.61 and 46.21-fold in heart and 3.68, 6.74 and 24.78-fold in lung. SMW with different doses of ABR groups exhibited better efficiency than SMW without ABR group on ameliorating knee joint swelling, inhibiting synovial hyperplasia and alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration of AGA rats. The treatment with ABR could down-regulate the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expressions of synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced articular distribution of berberine in SMW was attributed to the lower-guiding effect of ABR, which could evidently increase the plasma concentration of berberine, improve the supply of blood of inflamed joint, reduce the distribution of berberine in heart and lung and significantly inhibit the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression of synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats. The dose-response relationship of berberine between the enhanced articular concentration and improved anti-inflammatory effect in the knee joint under the lower-guiding of ABR was observed for the first time.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [2472, 2503], "name": "synovial tissues of knee joints"}, "h": {"pos": [2439, 2443], "name": "MDR1"}}

Leonurine (also named SCM-198), a compound extracted from Herba leonuri, was effective on the prevention of various cardiovascular and brain diseases. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible therapeutic potential of SCM-198 against ischemia reperfusion injury and underlying mechanisms. In the in vivo transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model, we found that treatment with SCM-198 could decrease infarct volume and improve neurological deficit by protecting against blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. In the in vitro model of cell oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), consistent results were obtained with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and maintained the BBB integrity. Further study demonstrated that SCM-198 increased the expression of histone deacetylase- (HDAC-) 4 which could inhibit NADPH oxidase- (NOX-) 4 and matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 9 expression, resulting in the elevation of tight junction proteins, including claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occluden- (ZO-) 1.

Recent studies have focused on identifying antagonists of hepcidin. We hypothesized that bioactive extracts from Chinese medicinal plants may be efficacious in the inhibition of expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene (HAMP) product, hepcidin. To test this, we measured the level of hepcidin expression in cultured cells treated with 16 different medicinal plant extracts, all of which are used to treat anemia-related disorders in traditional Chinese medicine. Among the extracts tested, that of Caulis Spatholobi (CS; also called Jixueteng, the stem of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn) showed the most potent inhibitory effect on HAMP expression in the Huh7 cell line and was therefore selected for further mechanistic study. In cells treated with 400 μg/mL of extract, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog proteins 1/5/8 levels were 80% less than those of controls (P < 0.001), and the inhibitory effect on interleukin-6-induced HAMP expression (65% inhibition) was weaker than the strong inhibition on bone morphogenetic protein 6-induced HAMP expression (97% inhibition). Seven-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were fed an AIN-76A diet containing 10.8% dried CS and then analyzed on d 0, 5, 10, or 15.

Furthermore, this study also aims to find which Chinese medicinal drug contained in MLN exerts the main pharmacological activity. METHODS: NASH model was induced in mice by feeding with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet. The effects of MLN on hepatic lipids accumulation, liver inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, and the expression of some molecules were investigated by histological observation, biochemical index analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Network pharmacology was applied to predict those involved molecular targets and potential mechanisms, which was further validated in vivo. BODIPY fluorescence staining assay was used to detect cellular lipids accumulation. RESULTS: MLN (7.8, 23.4 ml/kg) improved NASH in MCD-fed mice. Network pharmacology results demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway was crucially involved in the MLN-provided alleviation on NASH. Further experimental validation results showed that MLN increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and restored the decreased expression of nuclear PPARα in MCD-fed mice.

The effects of leonurine on Ang II-induced hypertensive cardiac injury remain unknown. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of leonurine in Ang II-infused mice and explored the underlying mechanisms in cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Cardiac injury was induced by Ang II infusion in experimental mice with or without leonurine (at 10 or 20 mg/kg) treatment. H9c2 cells and neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes were used to investigate the mechanisms through which leonurine exerts its protection effects. RESULTS: The results showed that leonurine significantly alleviated Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation in both mice and cultured cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography revealed that leonurine preserved cardiac function in mice. Further investigations revealed that leonurine inhibited the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways to reduce inflammatory response and injuries in Ang II-challenged cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of MAPKs and NF-κB in cardiomyocytes abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of leonurine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly assigned into sham-operated group (SHAM) and five ovariectomy (OVX) subgroups, i.e. OVX with vehicle (OVX); OVX with 17 β-ethinylestradiol (E(2), 25 μg/kg/day); OVX with ABRE of graded doses (100, 300, or 500 mg/kg/day). Daily oral administration of ABRE or E(2) started on week 4 after OVX for 16 weeks. Bone mass, bone turnover and strength were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), biochemical markers and three-point bending test. The trabecular bone microarchitecture was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (μCT). RESULTS: 16 weeks treatment of ABRE slowed down the body weight gain and prevented the loss of bone mass induced by the OVX. The prevention effect on bone loss was due to altering the rate of bone remodeling, which could be inferred from the decreased level of bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD). The changes of urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion provided the same evidence. The treatment could also enhance the bone strength and prevent the deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

Ovariectomized rats were treated with Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae alcohol extracts (containing 1.5 g/kg crude drug) or 0.1% aminoguanidine for 12 weeks and behavioral testing was performed with the Y-electrical maze. This test revealed that Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae and aminoguanidine could improve the learning and memory capabilities of ovariectomized rats. Results of competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that treatment with Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae or aminoguanidine reduced the accumulation of advanced glycation end products in the frontal cortex of ovariectomized rats, while increasing content in the blood and urine. Biochemical tests showed that treatment with Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae or aminoguanidine decreased superoxide dismutase activity in the serum and frontal cortex, and increased serum levels of glutathione peroxidase in ovariectomized rats. In addition, there was no apparent effect on malondialdehyde levels. These experimental findings indicate that Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae inhibits production of advanced glycation end products and its accumulation in brain tissue, and improves learning and memory capabilities in ovariectomized rats.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased.

In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the effect of co-treatment was attenuated after SRC knockdown, suggesting that SRC plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing induced by TALH and VEGF co-treatment.

{"text": "AB：Background: Cardiovascular diseases have become a major public health problem that seriously threatens human health. The cumulative effects of various cardiovascular events will eventually develop into chronic heart insufficiency and even heart failure, and the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway plays an important role in this process. Stachytine hydrochloride is the main active ingredient of Yimucao, which is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat gynecological diseases. Modern studies have found that stachytine hydrochloride has a good cardioprotective effect, but it is still unclear whether stachytine hydrochloride has an effect on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of stachytine hydrochloride on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway. Method: In this study, a continuous infusion of isoproterenol (40 mg/kg/day) was administered to mice and ventricular myocytes explored the potential mechanism of stachytine hydrochloride (12 mg/kg/day) on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway in the heart. Evaluate changes in cardiac morphology and function by echocardiography, cardiac hemodynamics, and histological methods, and detect molecular changes by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Treat primary cultured adult mouse or neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with or without isoproterenol (0.1 μMol), PNGase F (10(-2) units/ml), and stachytine hydrochloride (10 μMol) at different time points. Detect α-1,6-fucosylation on N-glycosylation, calcium transient, contraction, and relaxation function and related signals. Results: Stachytine hydrochloride reduces cardiac remodeling and modulates hemodynamic parameters during chronic β1 adrenergic receptor activation in vivo. The N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors decreased after continuous isoproterenol stimulation, while stachytine hydrochloride can increase the N-glycosylation of β1AR in the heart of mice with isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Decreased N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors will downregulate the cAMP/PKA signal pathway and inhibit myocardial excitation and contraction coupling.

However, the pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis was not well elucidated AIM OF STUDY: To determine the potential pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. The active fractions of Spatholobi Caulis were further screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gelatin precipitation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were used to purify the methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis, respectively. The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity. Western blotting assay showed that co-treatment of PSC increased the expression of VEGFRs and phosphorylation of MAPKs which decreased by VRI treatment. In addition, quality evaluation experiments showed that the content of total flavonoids of PSC reached 56.36% and the main pro-angiogenic fractions of PSC were F3, F4 and F5 both in zebrafish and HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PSC presented pro-angiogenic activity both in zebrafish and HUVECs, and principal pro-angiogenic active components were likely flavonoids. Thus, the current study provided evidence for the clinical usage of Spatholobi Caulis in promoting blood circulation and removing stasis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).", "relation": "is a", "t": {"pos": [2002, 2008], "name": "VEGFRs"}, "h": {"pos": [2034, 2038], "name": "Kdrl"}}
{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Clinical immunity to malaria in human populations is developed after repeated exposure to malaria. Regulation and balance of host immune responses may lead to optimal immunity against malaria parasite infection. Polysaccharides (ABPS) derived from the Chinese herb ox knee Achyranthes bidentata possess immuno-modulatory functions. The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells. In comparison, pretreatment with ABPS did not alter the number of natural Treg or the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with the immuno-modulatory ABPS selectively enhanced Th1 immune responses to control the proliferation of malaria parasites, and prolonged the survival of mice during subsequent malaria infection.", "relation": "is a", "t": {"pos": [813, 829], "name": "immune responses"}, "h": {"pos": [870, 879], "name": "cytokines"}}

In the in vitro model of bEnd.3 cell oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), treatment with SCM-198 restored the activity of catalase (CAT), improved the expression of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) production. SCM-198 treatment prevented OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis as indicated by increased cell viability and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, accompanied with upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein and downregulation Bax protein. The results were consistent with SH-SY5Y cells which coculture with bEnd.3 cells. The forthcoming study revealed that SCM-198 activated the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. All the data indicated that SCM-198 protected against oxidative stress and neuronal damage in in vivo and in vitro injury models via the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.

The immunomodulatory effect and mechanism of leonurine on monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDCs) from healthy donors (HDs) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients were investigated for the first time. Methods: Peripheral blood from HDs and MM patients was isolated for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The generation of moDCs was conducted by the incubation of monocytes from PBMCs in the medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 5% human serum, 800 U/mL GM-CSF, 500 U/mL IL-4, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. During the incubation of 7 days, the cells were administrated with 1 μM leonurine or 1 × PBS as the control group. On the 8th day, cells were harvested. The expression of maturation associated surface markers CD40, CD83, and HLA-DR on moDCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, moDCs with or without 1 μM leonurine administration were evaluated by LC-MS/MS for metabolomics which was further analyzed for the potential mechanism of leonurine on moDCs. Results: The proportion of moDCs in the harvested cells was significantly higher in the HD group (n = 14) than in the MM patient group (n = 11) (p = 0.000). Leonurine significantly enhanced the median fluorescence intensity of CD83, HLA-DR and CD40 expression on HD-moDCs (n = 14; p = 0.042, p = 0.013, p = 0.084) as well as MM paitent-moDCs (n = 11; p = 0.020, p = 0.006, p = 0.025). The metabolomics data showed that in moDCs (HD, n = 15), 18 metabolites in the pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism showed significant differences between the leonurine group and the control group (VIP all >1 and P all <0.05).

Emerging evidence indicates that leonurine produces neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of leonurine in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially in major depression, remains unknown. METHODS: We used the chronic mild stress mouse model to explore the antidepressant effects of leonurine and the potential mechanisms. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test were taken to evaluate depression symptoms. Moreover, the contents of monoamine neurotransmitters in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Neuronal morphology was detected by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Administration of leonurine (60 mg/kg) for 4 weeks significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors of chronic mild stress mice, including increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test. We further found that leonurine (60 mg/kg) effectively restored the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, and dopamine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of chronic mild stress mice, accompanied by amelioration of hippocampal neuronal damage. Furthermore, leonurine (60 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and TNF-α, and suppressed the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible effects of vaccarin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its underlying mechanism in the prevention and treatment of H2O2 injury. In this study, the EA.hy926 cells were exposed to 250, 500 and 1000 µM H2O2 for 2 and 4 h in the absence or presence of vaccarin, and the cell injury induced by H2O2 was examined via SRB. Cell migratory ability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were evaluated by the wound healing assay and corresponding assay kits. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide Apoptosis Detection kit and Hoechst staining. Furthermore, western blot detected the protein expressions of Notch1, Hes1 and caspase-3. Following treatment with H2O2, it was found that H2O2 stimulated cell injury in a dose-dependent manner, including reducing cell viability and cell migratory ability, increasing LDH leakage and MDA levels, and decreasing SOD activity. H2O2 further accelerated cell apoptosis via activation of Notch1 and the downstream molecule Hes1. Preincubation with vaccarin was found to protect EA.hy926 cells from H2O2-induced cell oxidative stress injury, which promoted cell viability and cell migratory ability, inhibited the level of LDH and MDA, but enhanced the activity of SOD. In particular, in addition to downregulation Notch signaling, vaccarin treatments also downregulated caspase-3, a cell apoptotic pathway-related protein.

FGR exerts the strongest vasodilatory effect, while CPR shows the least. The relaxation induced by SAA and FSC required intact endothelia. The mechanism of this vasodilation might involve eNOS.

However, its hematopoiesis-stimulating activity is not well understood. AIM OF STUDY: Four phenolic compounds (daidzein, formononetin, catechin, and procyandin B2) were isolated and purified from stems of S. suberectus, and tested using an in vitro hematopoiesis system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AGM-S3 co-culture system for hematopoiesis derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was employed to explore effects on hematopoiesis. At different stages, extracts from Spatholobus suberectus Dunn were added to the co-culture system at concentrations of 2, 10, or 50 μM, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), hematopoietic colony culturing, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to probe changes in hematopoietic progenitors and erythroid progenitors. RESULTS: When H1 hESCs co-cultured with AGM-S3 were added along with 10 μM catechin from day 12 (D12), proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic and erythroid progenitors from hESCs was increased based on FACS with antibodies recognizing CD34/CD45 and GPA/CD71. Hematopoiesis colony culturing further confirmed the promotion effect of catechin on hematopoiesis, and other active fractions did not significantly promote hematopoiesis. qRT-PCR revealed that some important genes related to hematopoiesis and erythroid were up-regulated followed catechin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that catechin, an active ingredient of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, can increase the efficiency of hematopoiesis, including hematopoietic and erythroid progenitors, consistent with previous reports.

At the end of the experiment, the effect of JXT on cell viability and G-CSF and G-CSFR levels in NFS-60 cells were tested by CCK-8 assay, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The results showed that the mice exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome.

Leonurine (LEO) is a unique alkaloid isolated from Leonurus japonicus Houtt (a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)), which has shown a good effect on promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In this study, we explored the protective effect and action mechanism of LEO on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after damage by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The protective effects of LEO on H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs were determined by measuring the cell viability, cell migration, tube formation, and oxidative biomarkers. The underlying mechanism of antioxidation of LEO was investigated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our results showed that LEO treatment promoted cell viability; remarkably downregulated the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and upregulated the nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs.

PURPOSE: The aim of present study was to investigate the anti-DVT mechanism of Spatholobi Caulis dispensing granule (SCDG). STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A rat model of inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis-induced DVT and a cell model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were performed. Rats were orally administered with SCDG solution once daily for seven consecutive days. IVC stenosis-induced DVT was operated on the sixth day. Thrombi were harvested and weighed on the seventh day. Pathological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β of serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with turbidimetric immunoassay. Protein expressions in thrombosed IVCs and/or OGD-stimulated EA. hy926 cells were evaluated by western blot and/or immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: SCDG dramatically decreased thrombus weight. SCDG decreased tissue factor (TF) protein expression, inflammatory cells influxes in thrombosed vein wall and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and CRP. Further, SCDG up-regulated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein expression and down-regulated acetylated-NF-κB p65 (Ace-p65) protein expression. Moreover, SCDG up-regulated nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions, and down-regulated phosphorylated-NF-κB p65 (p-p65) protein expression. In the OGD cell model, SCDG medicated serum decreased the protein expression of TF. SCDG medicated serum enhanced SIRT1 protein expression and reduced Ace-p65 nuclear protein expression. SCDG medicated serum promoted protein expressions of nuclear Nrf2 and total HO-1, and inhibited translocation of p65.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively.

Next, Western blot analysis and Real-time PCR were performed to analyze whether the Nrf2 and TLR4/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathways were involved in this process. We found that LEO pretreatment remarkably decreased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in I/R rats and attenuated acute tubular damage. In addition, LEO markedly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors. Further study revealed that LEO promoted Nrf2 into the nucleus, promoted the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and suppressed the TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway in kidney tissues of ischemic AKI rats.

The rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet received treatments of low, moderate, and high doses of SCM-198 and placebo concurrently. Eight weeks later, the animals underwent ultrasonographic imaging. They were then sacrificed for further pathological and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: SCM-198-treated rabbits showed a significant alleviation in the development of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. The lesions were smaller after the SCM-198 treatments. In addition, the elasticity of the arteries and hemodynamic status improved, accompanied with a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration and, macrophage infiltration, as well as the expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in the aortas. Marginal changes in the lipid parameters were found in the SCM-198-treated rabbits, with high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C) elevation and triglyceride (TG) reduction at the high dose. SCM-198 treatment dose-dependently reduced levels of serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the mRNA levels of VCAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), iNOS and MMP-9 in the aorta.

However, the underlying mechanisms of stachydrine hydrochloride haven't been comprehensively studied so far. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of stachydrine hydrochloride in heart failure and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, transverse aorta constriction was carried out in C57BL/6J mice, and thereafter, 7.2 mg/kg telmisartan (a selective AT1R antagonist as positive control) and 12 mg/kg stachydrine hydrochloride was administered daily intragastrically for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by assessing morphological changes as well as echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters. In vitro, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult mice cardiomyocytes were treated with stachydrine hydrochloride and challenged with phenylephrine (α-AR agonist). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of C57BL/6J mice by Langendorff crossflow perfusion system. Intracellular calcium was measured by an ion imaging system. The length and movement of sarcomere were traced to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of single myocardial cells. RESULTS: Stachydrine hydrochloride improved the cardiac function and calcium transient amplitudes, and inhibited the SR leakage and the amount of sparks in cardiac myocytes isolated from TAC mice. We also demonstrated that stachydrine hydrochloride could ameliorated phenylephrine-induced enhance in sarcomere contraction, calcium transients and calcium sparks. Moreover, our data shown that stachydrine hydrochloride blocked the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII, RyR2, PLN, and prevented the disassociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2.

In addition, the elasticity of the arteries and hemodynamic status improved, accompanied with a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration and, macrophage infiltration, as well as the expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in the aortas. Marginal changes in the lipid parameters were found in the SCM-198-treated rabbits, with high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C) elevation and triglyceride (TG) reduction at the high dose. SCM-198 treatment dose-dependently reduced levels of serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the mRNA levels of VCAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), iNOS and MMP-9 in the aorta. In addition, SCM-198 also dose-dependently increased the total antioxidant capacities and in parallel decreased the lipid peroxidation levels in the serum and liver. The antioxidant effects of SCM-198 were implicated by the enhanced activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and levels of glutathione (GSH) in the liver, as well as the mRNA levels of CAT, SOD-1 and GPx in the aorta. CONCLUSIONS: In a rabbit atherosclerotic model, SCM-198 dose-dependently ameliorated the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and vascular dysfunction accompanied by the suppression of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress. These findings suggested that SCM-198 might be a potential agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis.", "relation": "suppress", "t": {"pos": [2148, 2171], "name": "atherosclerotic lesions"}, "h": {"pos": [2092, 2099], "name": "SCM-198"}}
{"text": "AB：Objective: Leonurine is a bioactive alkaloid compound extracted from Leonurus japonicus Houtt, which potentially has immunomodulatory effects. The immunomodulatory effect and mechanism of leonurine on monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDCs) from healthy donors (HDs) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients were investigated for the first time. Methods: Peripheral blood from HDs and MM patients was isolated for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The generation of moDCs was conducted by the incubation of monocytes from PBMCs in the medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 5% human serum, 800 U/mL GM-CSF, 500 U/mL IL-4, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. During the incubation of 7 days, the cells were administrated with 1 μM leonurine or 1 × PBS as the control group. On the 8th day, cells were harvested. The expression of maturation associated surface markers CD40, CD83, and HLA-DR on moDCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, moDCs with or without 1 μM leonurine administration were evaluated by LC-MS/MS for metabolomics which was further analyzed for the potential mechanism of leonurine on moDCs. Results: The proportion of moDCs in the harvested cells was significantly higher in the HD group (n = 14) than in the MM patient group (n = 11) (p = 0.000). Leonurine significantly enhanced the median fluorescence intensity of CD83, HLA-DR and CD40 expression on HD-moDCs (n = 14; p = 0.042, p = 0.013, p = 0.084) as well as MM paitent-moDCs (n = 11; p = 0.020, p = 0.006, p = 0.025).

In particular, Chinese motherwort has been commonly used to treat disorders of mammary gland in Chinese traditional medicine (TCM). Chinese motherwort aqueous extract (MAE)was previously reported to have anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cells with low potency (IC50s in a range of 8-40 mg/mL). However, treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice. Therefore, anti-cancer activity of Chinese motherwort, especially in a form of ethanol extract, needs to be confirmed further at cellular level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aerial part of Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt) dry powder is extracted with 70% ethanol and the chemical components were characterized with HPLC finger print as well as mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity of the motherwort aqueous ethanol extract (MAEE) was analyzed with MTT assay on ER negative MDA-MB-231 and ER positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry were used to verify whether the cell death induced by MAEE is apoptosis in nature. Cell cycle status of MAEE treated cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that MAEE caused cell death in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion in both ER positive and negative breast cancer cells. Morphology, Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry evidence all indicated the cell death is not in an apoptotic nature. Furthermore, low concentrations of MAEE caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Chinese motherwort aqueous ethanol extract may effectively inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells through mechanisms of both cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest.

However, the molecular mechanism of action of leonurine in RA remains poorly understood. In this study, we detected 3,425 mRNAs differentially expressed between CD4(+) T cells of RA patients and those of healthy individuals using microarray raw data mining. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) regulates a variety of biological processes including T-helper (Th)-17 cell development, and was thus selected for functional verification. In a naïve CD4(+) T cell differentiation assay, we found that TAZ overexpression was associated with impaired balance between T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 cells in vitro. TAZ overexpression increased the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and decreased that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Leonurine treatment had a direct recovery effect on the impaired balance and reduced the expression of TAZ and led to normalization of IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α and IL-10. Furthermore, IL-6 was found to promote the expression of TAZ and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and RANK. Leonurine significantly inhibited TAZ-mediated expression of RANKL, and RANK and IL-6 in synovial fibroblasts.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of stachydrine hydrochloride in heart failure and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, transverse aorta constriction was carried out in C57BL/6J mice, and thereafter, 7.2 mg/kg telmisartan (a selective AT1R antagonist as positive control) and 12 mg/kg stachydrine hydrochloride was administered daily intragastrically for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by assessing morphological changes as well as echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters. In vitro, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult mice cardiomyocytes were treated with stachydrine hydrochloride and challenged with phenylephrine (α-AR agonist). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of C57BL/6J mice by Langendorff crossflow perfusion system. Intracellular calcium was measured by an ion imaging system. The length and movement of sarcomere were traced to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of single myocardial cells. RESULTS: Stachydrine hydrochloride improved the cardiac function and calcium transient amplitudes, and inhibited the SR leakage and the amount of sparks in cardiac myocytes isolated from TAC mice. We also demonstrated that stachydrine hydrochloride could ameliorated phenylephrine-induced enhance in sarcomere contraction, calcium transients and calcium sparks. Moreover, our data shown that stachydrine hydrochloride blocked the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII, RyR2, PLN, and prevented the disassociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that stachydrine hydrochloride exerts beneficial therapeutic effects against heart failure.

At the end of the experiment, the effect of JXT on cell viability and G-CSF and G-CSFR levels in NFS-60 cells were tested by CCK-8 assay, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The results showed that the mice exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome.

The determination of protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in hepatic and skeletal muscle tissues was used to study the mechanism of TFST. Moreover, the preliminary study of TFST on the antioxidant activity was performed. RESULTS: The TFST possessed anti-diabetic activities as shown by the decreased serum levels of fast blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobulin A1C (HbA1c), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acid (FFA), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucagon, as well as increased serum levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), insulin and C-peptide. TFST also improved the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to a certain degree. Furthermore, TFST increased the protein expression of PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, and increased the protein expressions of IRS-1 in hepatic and skeletal muscle tissues. These benefits were associated with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. CONCLUSIONS: TFST exert beneficial effects on hyperglycosemia and hyperlipoidemia in diabetic rats possibly through regulating the levers of PPAR-γ in adipose tissue and IRS-1 in hepatic and skeletal muscle tissues.", "relation": "suppress", "t": {"pos": [1545, 1566], "name": "malondialdehyde (MDA)"}, "h": {"pos": [1303, 1309], "name": " TFST "}}

L. japonicus has been regarded as a good gynecological medicine since ancient times. It has been widely used in clinical settings for treatment of gynecological diseases and postnatal rehabilitation with good efficacy and low adverse effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main purpose of this study was to determine the angiogenic and wound healing effects of total alkaloid fraction from L. japonicus Houtt. (TALH) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the effect of co-treatment was attenuated after SRC knockdown, suggesting that SRC plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing induced by TALH and VEGF co-treatment.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine suggests that Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae nourishes and protects the kidneys, the effect of which is enhanced following a salt treatment. Raw and salt-processed Achyranthes bidentata are produced via different processing techniques from the same crude Achyranthes root. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of this plant have been verified earlier. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the renal-protective effects. AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice. In the subsequent experiments, it was found that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts increased the uterine coefficient in sexually immature mice, improved the LPS-induced decrease in NRK52e cell viability, and reduced the apoptosis, which could be antagonized by ICI182, 780 (estrogen receptor-unspecific antagonist, Faslodex). CONCLUSIONS: The renal-protective effect of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes was exhibited through antiapoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms via an estrogen-like pathway, along with a modulation of the inflammatory response by regulating immune cells.

Meanwhile, ABPP reduced infarct size, plasma creatine kinase (CK)/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and myocardial apoptosis at the end of reperfusion in rat hearts. Moreover, ABPP preconditioning significantly inhibited superoxide generation, gp91phox expression, malonaldialdehyde formation and enhanced superoxide dismutase activity in I/R hearts. Furthermore, ABPP treatment inhibited PTEN expression and increased Akt phosphorylation in I/R rat heart. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked Akt activation, and abolished ABPP-stimulated anti-oxidant effect and cardioprotection. Our study demonstrated for the first time that ABPP reduces oxidative stress and exerts cardioprotection against MI/R injury in rats.

{"text": "AB：Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is a pathological process that accelerates cardiac remodeling in myocardial infarction (MI), and miR-29 has become one of the foci of research into MF. As an alkaloid extracted from Herba leonuri, leonurine (LE) has been found to be an effective natural active ingredient for inhibiting fibrosis in many preclinical experiments. However, whether LE protects against MF after MI through modifying miR-29 remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of LE on MF, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. A mouse model of MI was established, followed by administration of LE for 4 weeks. We found that LE effectively improved cardiac function, and attenuated fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in mice post-MI. In vitro, LE simultaneously inhibited proliferation and migration of neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), and the activation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblast generation was markedly suppressed by LE. Notably, we found that all mature miR-29 family members were downregulated in the myocardial tissues of mice post-MI, whereas LE significantly upregulated miR-29a-3p expression, and such upregulation was also detected in LE-treated CFs under Ang II stimulation. Knockdown of miR-29a-3p by a specific miRNA inhibitor upregulated the protein levels of TGF-β, collagen III, and collagen I in CFs, and completely reversed the antifibrotic effects of LE on CFs.

However, the corresponding active principles and anti-inflammatory mechanism of MPF are still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of present study is to evaluate the effect of MPF on CPID in the chronic pelvic inflammation (CPI) rat model and elucidate its possible anti-inflammatory mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CPI in rats was induced by administration with E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus. MPF (8.112g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage), 4.056g/(kg d) (10 times of adult dosage) and 2.028g/(kg d) (5 times of adult dosage)) and Jingangteng Capsule 2g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage) were administered orally for 20 days. The serum levels of five inflammation-associated cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1)) were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β(1), P53, Fas, FasL and MMP-2 in the uterus tissue were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry assay and the pathological changes induced in the uterus and ovary tissues were observed by histology. RESULTS: MPF caused a reduction in serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1). The expression of P53 mRNA, Fas/FasL mRNA and MMP-2 mRNA in the uterus tissue was significantly elevated after treating with MPF, in contrast the expression of TGF-β(1) mRNA was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissue was inhibited after treating with MPF.

Diabetic patients who are prone to develop diabetes-related complications often exhibit progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss). It is usual for small wounds to progress to ulceration, which especially worsens with peripheral arterial disease and in the presence of anaerobic bacteria, culminating into gangrene. In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study found that VAC promoted chronic wound healing in T1DM mice by activating the FOXP2/AGGF1 pathway, indicating that VAC may be a promising candidate for the treatment of the chronic wounds of diabetic patients.", "relation": "is a", "t": {"pos": [134, 164], "name": "diabetes-related complications"}, "h": {"pos": [179, 229], "name": "progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss)"}}

RESULTS: QGYS reduced the excretion of urinary protein and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alleviated the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in renal tissue. Additionally, QGYS effectively regulated the levels of transforming growth factor, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, and matrix metalloproteinases in the kidney of the rats.

AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice. In the subsequent experiments, it was found that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts increased the uterine coefficient in sexually immature mice, improved the LPS-induced decrease in NRK52e cell viability, and reduced the apoptosis, which could be antagonized by ICI182, 780 (estrogen receptor-unspecific antagonist, Faslodex). CONCLUSIONS: The renal-protective effect of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes was exhibited through antiapoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms via an estrogen-like pathway, along with a modulation of the inflammatory response by regulating immune cells.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

Bone marrow cells and hemogram including white cells, red cells, platelet counts, and hemoglobin level were examined. The protein expression levels of pJAK2/JAK2, pSTAT5a/STAT5a, pSTAT5b/STAT5b, and Bcl-2 in bone marrow tissue; levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in serum and liver tissue were determined. At the end of the experiment, the effect of JXT on cell viability and G-CSF and G-CSFR levels in NFS-60 cells were tested by CCK-8 assay, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The results showed that the mice exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome. In contrast, at the end of the 28-day experiment, irradiated mice subjected to oral administration of JXT showed an obvious improvement on blood profile with reduced leucopenia, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts), RBC, and hemoglobin levels, as well as bone marrow cells. The expression of pJAK2/JAK2, pSTAT5a/STAT5a, and Bcl-2 in bone marrow tissue was increased after JXT treatment. The elevation of ROS was due to radiation-induced toxicity, but JXT significantly reduced the ROS level in serum and liver tissue, elevated endogenous SOD and GSH-PX levels, and reduced the MDA level in the liver.

Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKα knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis. Conditional medium collected from ESMW-treated 3T3-L1 cells ameliorated insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis in liver cells, demonstrating the antilipolytic activity contributed to ESMW beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production. In conclusion, ESMW, as the antilipolytic fraction of SMW, inhibited PKA-HSL related lipolysis by activating AMPK, thus inhibiting diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in the liver and thereby improving insulin resistance and hepatic gluconeogenesis.", "relation": "suppress", "t": {"pos": [1689, 1704], "name": "hepatic glucose"}, "h": {"pos": [1661, 1667], "name": " ESMW "}}

However, the molecular mechanism of action of leonurine in RA remains poorly understood. In this study, we detected 3,425 mRNAs differentially expressed between CD4(+) T cells of RA patients and those of healthy individuals using microarray raw data mining. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) regulates a variety of biological processes including T-helper (Th)-17 cell development, and was thus selected for functional verification. In a naïve CD4(+) T cell differentiation assay, we found that TAZ overexpression was associated with impaired balance between T regulatory (Treg) and Th17 cells in vitro. TAZ overexpression increased the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and decreased that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Leonurine treatment had a direct recovery effect on the impaired balance and reduced the expression of TAZ and led to normalization of IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α and IL-10. Furthermore, IL-6 was found to promote the expression of TAZ and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and RANK.

In particular, Chinese motherwort has been commonly used to treat disorders of mammary gland in Chinese traditional medicine (TCM). Chinese motherwort aqueous extract (MAE)was previously reported to have anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cells with low potency (IC50s in a range of 8-40 mg/mL). However, treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice. Therefore, anti-cancer activity of Chinese motherwort, especially in a form of ethanol extract, needs to be confirmed further at cellular level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aerial part of Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt) dry powder is extracted with 70% ethanol and the chemical components were characterized with HPLC finger print as well as mass spectrometry. Cytotoxicity of the motherwort aqueous ethanol extract (MAEE) was analyzed with MTT assay on ER negative MDA-MB-231 and ER positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry were used to verify whether the cell death induced by MAEE is apoptosis in nature. Cell cycle status of MAEE treated cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that MAEE caused cell death in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion in both ER positive and negative breast cancer cells. Morphology, Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry evidence all indicated the cell death is not in an apoptotic nature. Furthermore, low concentrations of MAEE caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In actual clinic practice, patients are more likely to receive treatments after AS plaque formation. Therefore, the efficacy of ZXC on formed AS plaques and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simvastatin (positive control) and ZXC (420 mg/kg and 840 mg/kg) were administrated to rats which first received long-term high fat diet administration (12 weeks). The blood lipid profiles of rats were monitored during the whole experiment, and the thoracic arteries were collected at the end of experiment for AS assessment (18th week). The blood-dissolved ZXC components were determined using an UPLC-QTOF-MS method, and the attained components were then used for network pharmacology analysis to predict the key ZXC components and targets. At last, the predicted targets were validated by ELISA and western blot methods. RESULTS: ZXC administration showed good blood lipid-lowering effect by significantly reduced LDL-C and TC levels in rats while significantly increased HDL-C level.

Rat chondrocytes were pretreated with ABS at 3 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, and 30 μg/mL, and subsequently stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL). Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining demonstrated that ABS could protect IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury. ABS suppressed IL-1β-induced apoptosis by suppressing the activation of caspase-3, inhibiting levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bad, decreasing p53 protein phosphorylation, and promoting the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. IL-1β-induced inflammation and matrix degradation were also alleviated by ABS through the downregulation of the expressions of matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9 and cyclooxygenase-2. Moreover, ABS inhibited IL-1β-induced nuclear factor κB activation in rat chondrocytes. We demonstrated, for the first time, the protective effects of ABS on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes and their molecular mechanisms. Thus, it is suggested that ABS might be a potential drug in the treatment of osteoarthritis.", "relation": "cause", "t": {"pos": [1032, 1044], "name": "inflammation"}, "h": {"pos": [1018, 1023], "name": "IL-1β"}}

In addition, we used network pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to verify the experimental results. In LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, leonurine significantly reduced the production of TNF-α and IL-6, andinhibited the activation of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. In OVA-induced asthmatic mice, leonurine decreased the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), particularly neutrophils and eosinophils. Leonurine also reduced the contents of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 in the BALF and OVA-IgE in the serum. Leonurine remarkly improved OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and significantly inhibited mucus overproduction. In addition, leonurine inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice. Network pharmacology suggested that p38 MAPKα was a potential target of leonurine in the treatment of asthma. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that leonurine could stably bind to p38 MAPKα protein.

However, its hematopoiesis-stimulating activity is not well understood. AIM OF STUDY: Four phenolic compounds (daidzein, formononetin, catechin, and procyandin B2) were isolated and purified from stems of S. suberectus, and tested using an in vitro hematopoiesis system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AGM-S3 co-culture system for hematopoiesis derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was employed to explore effects on hematopoiesis. At different stages, extracts from Spatholobus suberectus Dunn were added to the co-culture system at concentrations of 2, 10, or 50 μM, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), hematopoietic colony culturing, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to probe changes in hematopoietic progenitors and erythroid progenitors. RESULTS: When H1 hESCs co-cultured with AGM-S3 were added along with 10 μM catechin from day 12 (D12), proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic and erythroid progenitors from hESCs was increased based on FACS with antibodies recognizing CD34/CD45 and GPA/CD71. Hematopoiesis colony culturing further confirmed the promotion effect of catechin on hematopoiesis, and other active fractions did not significantly promote hematopoiesis. qRT-PCR revealed that some important genes related to hematopoiesis and erythroid were up-regulated followed catechin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that catechin, an active ingredient of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, can increase the efficiency of hematopoiesis, including hematopoietic and erythroid progenitors, consistent with previous reports.

METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice.

TMYX has marketed in China for the treatment of chest pain, palpitation, angina, irregular heartbeat and coronary heart disease (CHD) for several decades. Previous studies have confirmed that TMYX can treat CHD by reducing inflammation, but the underlying pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to declare the underlying pharmacological mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of TMYX in the treatment of CHD via clinical trial, microarray study, bioinformatics analysis and the vitro assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight CHD patients' serum biochemical indices including coagulation function, lipid metabolism, endothelial injury, metalloprotease, adhesion molecule, inflammatory mediator and homocysteine were measured to investigate the reduction of CHD risk by TMYX oral administration (40 pills/time, 2 times/day) for eight weeks. The expression profile chips and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were assessed to reveal the global transcriptional response and predict related functions, diseases and canonical pathways. The in vitro anti-inflammatory actions of TMYX were evaluated using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (100 μg/mL) induced murine RAW264.7 macrophage with an ethanol extract from TMYX (EETMYX) (25-100 μg/mL). RESULTS: TMYX treatment showed reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, endothelin 1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and homocysteine in CHD patients. In contrast, the treatment increased the ratio of apolipoprotein A/apolipoprotein B. EETMYX restored cell morphology and suppressed the lipid deposition of the induced foam cells. EETMYX exerted anti-inflammatory effects by raising the mRNA and protein expression of Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), blocking the reduction of IκBa level and the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκBα and NF-κB p65, accompanied by inhibiting MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 production, which were consistent with bioinformatics predictions.

In this study, the role of leonurine (LN), a traditional Chinese medicine isolated from Herba leonuri, in promoting angiogenesis and its function in wound healing have been investigated. The results of co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that LN treatment (5-20 μM) could promote the proliferation and migration and enhance the ability of in vitro angiogenesis through up-regulating the mTOR/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, a full-thickness cutaneous wound model was used to investigate the healing effect of LN in vivo. Intragastric administration of 20 mg per kg per day LN stimulated the regeneration of more blood vessels at the wound sites, which confirmed the in vitro results of promoting angiogenesis. Due to fast vascularization, the collagen matrix deposition and remodeling processes were also accelerated in LN treated wounds, resulting in efficient wound healing. In summary, LN promoted angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro by activating the mTOR/ERK pathway, and could efficiently enhance the angiogenesis and collagen deposition of the regenerated tissue, together with facilitating the wound healing process in vivo.

Chinese Herbal Medicine with antioxidant properties is believed to have potential therapeutic effect. Leonurine, an alkaloid present in Herba Leonuri (HL), has shown biological effects such as antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-apoptosis and protection against ischemic heart disease. In this study, neuroprotective effects of leonurine against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in cortex were evaluated. We used transient rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of brain ischemia. The rats were treated with their respective treatments for 1 week prior to the MCAO. We found that leonurine significantly improved neurological outcome and reduced ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral infarction 24 h after MCAO. Leonurine decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cortex, which was increased by MCAO. Terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining showed anti-apoptotic effect of leonurine on ischemic cortex. Western blot analysis showed a marked decrease in the expression of Bax and an increase of Bcl-2 as a result of leonurine treatment. The attenuation of mitochondrial membrane swelling, restore of mitochondrial membrane potential and content of cytochrome c (Cyt-C) in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cortex could also be observed in leonurine treated group.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Clinical immunity to malaria in human populations is developed after repeated exposure to malaria. Regulation and balance of host immune responses may lead to optimal immunity against malaria parasite infection. Polysaccharides (ABPS) derived from the Chinese herb ox knee Achyranthes bidentata possess immuno-modulatory functions. The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells. In comparison, pretreatment with ABPS did not alter the number of natural Treg or the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with the immuno-modulatory ABPS selectively enhanced Th1 immune responses to control the proliferation of malaria parasites, and prolonged the survival of mice during subsequent malaria infection.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1043, 1072], "name": "mice after P. y17XL infection"}, "h": {"pos": [1026, 1039], "name": "survival time"}}

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a powerful inflammatory signal contributing to monocytes/macrophages activation associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines expressions. We recently identified that vaccarin was expected to protect endothelial cells from injury. Hypaphorine was abundantly found in vaccaria semen. However, the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of vaccaria hypaphorine on macrophage inflammation have been poorly defined. METHODS: This study was designed to determine the effects of vaccaria hypaphorine on LPS-mediated inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that vaccaria hypaphorine dramatically ameliorated LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) release and productions of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) in RAW 264.7 cells. LPS-stimulated expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were down-regulated by vaccaria hypaphorine. Furthermore, vaccaria hypaphorine retarded LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκB), NFκB inhibitor IκBα, and IKKβ. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that vaccaria hypaphorine eliminated the nuclear translocation of NFκB in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells.

Daily oral administration of ABRE or E(2) started on week 4 after OVX for 16 weeks. Bone mass, bone turnover and strength were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), biochemical markers and three-point bending test. The trabecular bone microarchitecture was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (μCT). RESULTS: 16 weeks treatment of ABRE slowed down the body weight gain and prevented the loss of bone mass induced by the OVX. The prevention effect on bone loss was due to altering the rate of bone remodeling, which could be inferred from the decreased level of bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD). The changes of urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion provided the same evidence. The treatment could also enhance the bone strength and prevent the deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture.

Diabetic patients who are prone to develop diabetes-related complications often exhibit progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss). It is usual for small wounds to progress to ulceration, which especially worsens with peripheral arterial disease and in the presence of anaerobic bacteria, culminating into gangrene. In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways.

This study aimed to screen the antilipolytic fraction from SMW and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms on hepatic insulin resistance. Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKα knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis. Conditional medium collected from ESMW-treated 3T3-L1 cells ameliorated insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis in liver cells, demonstrating the antilipolytic activity contributed to ESMW beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to declare the underlying pharmacological mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of TMYX in the treatment of CHD via clinical trial, microarray study, bioinformatics analysis and the vitro assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight CHD patients' serum biochemical indices including coagulation function, lipid metabolism, endothelial injury, metalloprotease, adhesion molecule, inflammatory mediator and homocysteine were measured to investigate the reduction of CHD risk by TMYX oral administration (40 pills/time, 2 times/day) for eight weeks. The expression profile chips and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were assessed to reveal the global transcriptional response and predict related functions, diseases and canonical pathways. The in vitro anti-inflammatory actions of TMYX were evaluated using oxidized low-density lipoprotein (100 μg/mL) induced murine RAW264.7 macrophage with an ethanol extract from TMYX (EETMYX) (25-100 μg/mL). RESULTS: TMYX treatment showed reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, endothelin 1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and homocysteine in CHD patients. In contrast, the treatment increased the ratio of apolipoprotein A/apolipoprotein B. EETMYX restored cell morphology and suppressed the lipid deposition of the induced foam cells. EETMYX exerted anti-inflammatory effects by raising the mRNA and protein expression of Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), blocking the reduction of IκBa level and the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκBα and NF-κB p65, accompanied by inhibiting MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 production, which were consistent with bioinformatics predictions.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days.

RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity.

After 3 days, the rats that underwent TAC were randomized to treatment for a total of four experimental groups (n=10 each group): sham operation, TAC only, TAC + telmisartan (Tel), and TAC + stachydrine (Sta). After 12 weeks, we evaluated left ventricular hypertrophy, function, and fibrosis by echocardiography, pressure-volume loop analysis, and histology. In addition, levels of fibrosis-related proteins in the heart were determined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that Sta significantly suppressed TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and TAC-induced increases in heart weight/body weight and heart weight/tibial length. In addition, Sta attenuated TAC-induced decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction and improved other hemodynamic parameters. Compared with the TAC only group, rats treated with Sta exhibited significant decreases in interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, TGF-βR1 protein levels, and phosphorylation of Smad2/3; however, protein levels of TGF-β1, TGF-βR2, and Smad4 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Sta protects against diastolic heart failure by attenuating myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis via the TGF-β/Smad pathway.", "relation": "ameliorates", "t": {"pos": [1126, 1148], "name": "hemodynamic parameters"}, "h": {"pos": [1031, 1036], "name": " Sta "}}
{"text": "AB：There are reports of early evidence that suggest the involvement of chronic low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. Thus, substances that have effects in reducing inflammation could be potential drugs for Type 2 diabetes. Leonurine (4-guanidino-n-butyl syringate; SCM-198) is an alkaloid in HL (Herba leonuri), which was reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesize that SCM-198 may have beneficial effects on Type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we attempted to test this hypothesis by evaluating the anti-diabetic effect of SCM-198 and the possible underlying mechanisms of its effects in db/db mice. SCM-198 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight), pioglitazone (50 mg/kg of body weight, as a positive control) or 1% CMC-Na (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) were administered to the db/db or db/m mice once daily for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, SCM-198 (200 mg/kg of body weight) treatment significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose level and increased the plasma insulin concentration in the db/db mice, meanwhile it significantly lowered the plasma TAG (triacylglycerol) concentration and increased the HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol concentration. Moreover, the dysregulated transcription of the hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes, including GK (glucokinase), G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase) and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), was recovered by an Akt-dependent pathway. The pro-inflammatory mediators {such as TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α), IL (interleukin)-6, IL-1β, degradation of IκB [inhibitor of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)] α and thereafter activation of NF-κB} were reversed by SCM-198 treatment in the db/db mice. The present study provides first evidence that SCM-198 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and has an ameliorating effect on diabetic symptoms via inhibiting of NF-κB/IKK (IκB kinase) pathway. Consequently, we suggest that SCM-198 may be a prospective agent for prevention and/or moderation of the progress of Type 2 diabetes.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1093, 1099], "name": "plasma"}, "h": {"pos": [1100, 1121], "name": "TAG (triacylglycerol)"}}

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health issue nearly across the world. Diabetic patients who are prone to develop diabetes-related complications often exhibit progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss). It is usual for small wounds to progress to ulceration, which especially worsens with peripheral arterial disease and in the presence of anaerobic bacteria, culminating into gangrene. In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study found that VAC promoted chronic wound healing in T1DM mice by activating the FOXP2/AGGF1 pathway, indicating that VAC may be a promising candidate for the treatment of the chronic wounds of diabetic patients.", "relation": "is part of", "t": {"pos": [497, 512], "name": "vaccariae semen"}, "h": {"pos": [429, 443], "name": "vaccarin (VAC)"}}

At the end of the experiment, the effect of JXT on cell viability and G-CSF and G-CSFR levels in NFS-60 cells were tested by CCK-8 assay, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The results showed that the mice exposed to γ-radiation alone exhibited a typical hematopoietic syndrome. In contrast, at the end of the 28-day experiment, irradiated mice subjected to oral administration of JXT showed an obvious improvement on blood profile with reduced leucopenia, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts), RBC, and hemoglobin levels, as well as bone marrow cells. The expression of pJAK2/JAK2, pSTAT5a/STAT5a, and Bcl-2 in bone marrow tissue was increased after JXT treatment.

METHODS: An OA rat model was developed by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) followed by treadmill running. A herbal paste including Dipsaci Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Eucommiae Cortex and Psoraleae Fructus, named as DAEP, was applied topically on the knee joint of the rats (DAEP). The rats without DAEP treatment served as Control. Rats with surgery but without ACLT, treadmill running and DAEP treatment acted as Sham. The morphologic change of the knee joint was observed radiographically. Nociception from the knee of the rats was assessed using Incapacitent test and CatWalk gait system. The therapeutic mechanism was investigated by analyzing the gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers via qPCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Radiographic images showed less destruction at the posterior tibial plateau of the DAEP group compared with the Control after 2 weeks of treatment.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective chemotherapeutic that is effective for various tumours. However, the clinical application of DOX has been limited by adverse reactions such as cardiotoxicity and heart failure. Since DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is irreversible, drugs to prevent DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are needed. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of total flavonoids of Selaginella tamariscina (P.Beauv.) Spring (TFST) on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: The present study established DOX-induced cardiotoxicity models in C57BL/6 mice treated with DOX (cumulative dose: 20 mg/kg body weight) and H9c2 cells incubated with DOX (1 μM/l) to explore the intervention effect and potential mechanism of TFST. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate left ventricular functions. Heart tissue samples were collected for histological evaluation. Myocardial injury markers and oxidative stress markers were examined. Mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway associated proteins PPARα/PGC-1α/Sirt3 were detected. We also explored the effects of TFST on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis. To further investigate the protective mechanism of TFST, we used the specific small interfering RNA MFN2 (siMFN2) to explore the effect of MFN2 on TFST against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vitro. Flow cytometry detected reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Cell mitochondrial stress was measured by Seahorse XF analyser. RESULTS: Both in vivo and in vitro studies verified that TFST observably alleviated DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. However, these effects were reversed after transfected siMFN2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that TFST ameliorates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress by activating MFN2/PERK.

RESULTS: From the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from fractionation of the methanol extract of S. suberectus Dunn, medicarpin, formononetin and isoliquiritigenin were successfully isolated through a combination of normal- and reversed-phase chromatography. Genistein and naringenin, which were already reported to be contained in S. suberectus Dunn, were also tested for their antimutagenicity towards MNU, along with formononetin, isoliquiritigenin and medicarpin. Our results demonstrated that genistein, isoliquiritigenin, medicarpin and naringenin were antimutagenic against MNU without showing cytotoxicity. MNU is reported to cause not only DNA alkylation but also induce reactive oxygen species. The hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of the flavonoids was correlated with the antimutagenic capacity, indicating that the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was involved in their antimutagenicity towards MNU.

Thus, the present study was performed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of Selaginella tamariscina ethanol extract (STE) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and identify the molecular mechanism responsible. STE was prepared by heating in 70% ethanol and its quality was confirmed by HPLC. STE dose-dependently inhibited the productions of inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE(2)) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. STE markedly suppressed the phosphorylations of MAPKs, IκB-α, and NF-κB and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB induced by LPS stimulation. In addition, STE exhibited good free radical scavenging activity and prevented ROS generation by LPS. STE also upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 and promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Taken together, STE was found to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on RAW 264.7 macrophages and the mechanism appeared to involve the MAPK, NF-κB, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways.

To test this, we measured the level of hepcidin expression in cultured cells treated with 16 different medicinal plant extracts, all of which are used to treat anemia-related disorders in traditional Chinese medicine. Among the extracts tested, that of Caulis Spatholobi (CS; also called Jixueteng, the stem of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn) showed the most potent inhibitory effect on HAMP expression in the Huh7 cell line and was therefore selected for further mechanistic study. In cells treated with 400 μg/mL of extract, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog proteins 1/5/8 levels were 80% less than those of controls (P < 0.001), and the inhibitory effect on interleukin-6-induced HAMP expression (65% inhibition) was weaker than the strong inhibition on bone morphogenetic protein 6-induced HAMP expression (97% inhibition).

AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway.

Also, ABPPk demonstrated an earlier start in these molecular regulations than NGF. Furthermore, the analysis of transcription factors also illustrated that ABPPk not only had more key initial regulatory factors participating in vascular-related processes, but these also remained for a longer period. There was no significant difference in neural-related molecular regulation between the two groups.

Raw and salt-processed Achyranthes bidentata are produced via different processing techniques from the same crude Achyranthes root. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of this plant have been verified earlier. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the renal-protective effects. AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice. In the subsequent experiments, it was found that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts increased the uterine coefficient in sexually immature mice, improved the LPS-induced decrease in NRK52e cell viability, and reduced the apoptosis, which could be antagonized by ICI182, 780 (estrogen receptor-unspecific antagonist, Faslodex). CONCLUSIONS: The renal-protective effect of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes was exhibited through antiapoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms via an estrogen-like pathway, along with a modulation of the inflammatory response by regulating immune cells.

Furthermore, in cultured human microvascular endothelial cell-1 (HMEC-1) cells, we showed that pretreatment with VAC dose-dependently increased nitric oxide (NO) generation and the phosphorylation of eNOS under HG conditions.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1370, 1382], "name": "apoE-/- mice"}, "h": {"pos": [1316, 1359], "name": "low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)"}}

We hypothesize that SCM-198 may have beneficial effects on Type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we attempted to test this hypothesis by evaluating the anti-diabetic effect of SCM-198 and the possible underlying mechanisms of its effects in db/db mice. SCM-198 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight), pioglitazone (50 mg/kg of body weight, as a positive control) or 1% CMC-Na (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) were administered to the db/db or db/m mice once daily for 3 weeks.

{"text": "AB：Background: Cardiovascular diseases have become a major public health problem that seriously threatens human health. The cumulative effects of various cardiovascular events will eventually develop into chronic heart insufficiency and even heart failure, and the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway plays an important role in this process. Stachytine hydrochloride is the main active ingredient of Yimucao, which is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat gynecological diseases. Modern studies have found that stachytine hydrochloride has a good cardioprotective effect, but it is still unclear whether stachytine hydrochloride has an effect on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of stachytine hydrochloride on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway. Method: In this study, a continuous infusion of isoproterenol (40 mg/kg/day) was administered to mice and ventricular myocytes explored the potential mechanism of stachytine hydrochloride (12 mg/kg/day) on the β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway in the heart. Evaluate changes in cardiac morphology and function by echocardiography, cardiac hemodynamics, and histological methods, and detect molecular changes by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Treat primary cultured adult mouse or neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with or without isoproterenol (0.1 μMol), PNGase F (10(-2) units/ml), and stachytine hydrochloride (10 μMol) at different time points. Detect α-1,6-fucosylation on N-glycosylation, calcium transient, contraction, and relaxation function and related signals. Results: Stachytine hydrochloride reduces cardiac remodeling and modulates hemodynamic parameters during chronic β1 adrenergic receptor activation in vivo. The N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors decreased after continuous isoproterenol stimulation, while stachytine hydrochloride can increase the N-glycosylation of β1AR in the heart of mice with isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Decreased N-glycosylation of β1 adrenergic receptors will downregulate the cAMP/PKA signal pathway and inhibit myocardial excitation and contraction coupling. Stachytine hydrochloride significantly reduced isoproterenol-induced cardiac N-linked glycoproteins with α-1,6-fucosylation. Conclusion: Our results show that stachytine hydrochloride inhibits the synthesis of α-1,6-fucosylation on the N-terminal sugar chain by reducing α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) and α-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase A (MGAT4a), upregulating the N-glycosylation level on β1 adrenergic receptors, and maintaining cAMP/PKA signal pathway activation.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1078, 1083], "name": "heart"}, "h": {"pos": [1033, 1070], "name": "β1 adrenergic receptor signal pathway"}}

The results of co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that LN treatment (5-20 μM) could promote the proliferation and migration and enhance the ability of in vitro angiogenesis through up-regulating the mTOR/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, a full-thickness cutaneous wound model was used to investigate the healing effect of LN in vivo. Intragastric administration of 20 mg per kg per day LN stimulated the regeneration of more blood vessels at the wound sites, which confirmed the in vitro results of promoting angiogenesis. Due to fast vascularization, the collagen matrix deposition and remodeling processes were also accelerated in LN treated wounds, resulting in efficient wound healing. In summary, LN promoted angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro by activating the mTOR/ERK pathway, and could efficiently enhance the angiogenesis and collagen deposition of the regenerated tissue, together with facilitating the wound healing process in vivo.

In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways.

It is therefore presumed that JFP could be used for the therapy of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) but the assumed efficacy has not been fully substantiated in experiment. AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, JFP was validated to regulate the mRNA expression of FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, MMP3, MMP13 and COX-2 and decrease the release of IL-17A and the protein expression of IL-6 and suppress the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in CTX induced POI rats. CONCLUSION: Jinfeng Pill is effective to ameliorate the symptoms of POI induced by CTX in the model of rats and its action is likely associated with suppressing IL-17A/IL-6 axis and the activity of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling.", "relation": "is part of", "t": {"pos": [35, 53], "name": "Jinfeng Pill (JFP)"}, "h": {"pos": [300, 350], "name": "Reynoutria multiflora (Thunb.)

Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have demonstrated that leonurine, a unique alkaloid compound of Herba leonuri, can exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects on the development of atherosclerosis (AS). This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "promote", "t": {"pos": [1866, 1874], "name": "ABCA1/G1"}, "h": {"pos": [1908, 1917], "name": "leonurine"}}

It has been widely used in clinical settings for treatment of gynecological diseases and postnatal rehabilitation with good efficacy and low adverse effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main purpose of this study was to determine the angiogenic and wound healing effects of total alkaloid fraction from L. japonicus Houtt. (TALH) in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the effect of co-treatment was attenuated after SRC knockdown, suggesting that SRC plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing induced by TALH and VEGF co-treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that TALH was one of the main active components of L. japonicus that promoted angiogenesis and wound healing by regulating the SRC/MEK/ERK pathway.

However, the natural sources of PPT, Sinopodophyllum hexandrum (Royle) T. S. Ying and Podophyllum peltatum L., are already endangered species because of their intensive industrial exploitation. Therefore, identification of other sources of PPT is necessary. This study is a broad comparative investigation of junipers, for which original sources have been accessed from different continents of the world. The present research is aimed at the identification of species, producing PPT and other lignans at concentrations that are sufficient for the high antiproliferative activity of the corresponding extracts. Cytotoxic juniper leaf extracts demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity on a panel of cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative properties of junipers were attributed to the combined activity of great diversity of lignans (podophyllotoxin, deoxypodophyllotoxin, β-peltatin, yatein, matairesinol, anhydropodorhizol, etc.), detected by UHPLC-HRMS and LC-ESI-MS/MS in the corresponding extracts.

However, the pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis was not well elucidated AIM OF STUDY: To determine the potential pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. The active fractions of Spatholobi Caulis were further screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gelatin precipitation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were used to purify the methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis, respectively. The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity. Western blotting assay showed that co-treatment of PSC increased the expression of VEGFRs and phosphorylation of MAPKs which decreased by VRI treatment. In addition, quality evaluation experiments showed that the content of total flavonoids of PSC reached 56.36% and the main pro-angiogenic fractions of PSC were F3, F4 and F5 both in zebrafish and HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PSC presented pro-angiogenic activity both in zebrafish and HUVECs, and principal pro-angiogenic active components were likely flavonoids.

We found leonurine significantly decreased levels of LDH and CK activities in plasma. This observation corresponded with decreased infarct size of ischemic rat heart induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. Moreover, the mRNA expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax was significantly down-regulated by 0.68-fold (p < 0.05) and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was up-regulated by 1.41-fold (p < 0.05) in the leonurine treated groups as compared with acute myocardium ischemia (MI) controls measured by RT-PCR. Correspondingly, Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels detected by Western blotting coincided with gene expression levels. In addition, the mRNA expression level of the antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD was significantly increased 1.23-fold (p < 0.05) and this finding corresponded with an observed increase in SOD activity and also with a committed decrease in lipid peroxidation. Taken together, our results demonstrated that leonurine attenuated myocardium injury during MI via antioxidative and anti-apoptotic effects and leonurine might become a useful adjuvant cardioprotective agent.", "relation": "is correlated with", "t": {"pos": [1408, 1425], "name": "myocardium injury"}, "h": {"pos": [1458, 1480], "name": "anti-apoptotic effects"}}
{"text": "AB：Despite the precise mechanisms for renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) are poorly understood, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways were considered as the important targets. Leonurine (LEO) is a special alkaloid extracted from Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt), which has an anti-inflammatory effect and reduces oxidative stress. We conducted the study to explore the efficacy of LEO against I/R-induced AKI in rats and further investigated the underlying mechanisms. Ischemic renal injury was induced by temporary vascular clamping for 45 min. We have measured the levels of inflammation-related biomarkers and antioxidative stress markers. Next, Western blot analysis and Real-time PCR were performed to analyze whether the Nrf2 and TLR4/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathways were involved in this process. We found that LEO pretreatment remarkably decreased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in I/R rats and attenuated acute tubular damage. In addition, LEO markedly increased the expression of antioxidant proteins and decreased the levels of inflammatory factors. Further study revealed that LEO promoted Nrf2 into the nucleus, promoted the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and suppressed the TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway in kidney tissues of ischemic AKI rats.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in apoE-/- mice were evaluated using enzymatic methods. The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "promote", "t": {"pos": [2314, 2322], "name": "ABCA1/G1"}, "h": {"pos": [2199, 2208], "name": "Leonurine"}}

In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. Furthermore, the effect of co-treatment was attenuated after SRC knockdown, suggesting that SRC plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing induced by TALH and VEGF co-treatment.

Diabetic patients who are prone to develop diabetes-related complications often exhibit progressive neuropathy (painless and sensory loss). It is usual for small wounds to progress to ulceration, which especially worsens with peripheral arterial disease and in the presence of anaerobic bacteria, culminating into gangrene. In our study, vaccarin (VAC), the main active monomer extracted from Chinese herb vaccariae semen, is proven to have a role in promoting diabetic chronic wound healing through a cytoprotective role under high glucose conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a pressure ulcer on both VAC-treated and control mice based on a type 1 diabetes (T1DM) model. The wound healing index was evaluated by an experimental wound assessment tool (EWAT). We also determined the effect of VAC on the proliferation and cell migration of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) by a cell counting kit (CCK-8), a scratch and transwell assay. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VAC could promote the proliferation and migration of high glucose-stimulated HMEC-1 cells, which depend on the activation of FOXP2/AGGF1. Activation of the angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) caused enhanced phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and extracellular regulated protein kinases (Erk1/2). By silencing the expression of forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) protein by siRNA, both mRNA and protein expression of AGGF1 were downregulated, leading to a decreased proliferation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. In addition, a diabetic chronic wound model in vivo unveiled that VAC had a positive effect on chronic wound healing, which involved the activation of the above-mentioned pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study found that VAC promoted chronic wound healing in T1DM mice by activating the FOXP2/AGGF1 pathway, indicating that VAC may be a promising candidate for the treatment of the chronic wounds of diabetic patients.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1643, 1671], "name": "diabetic chronic wound model"}, "h": {"pos": [1723, 1744], "name": "chronic wound healing"}}

However, the pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis was not well elucidated AIM OF STUDY: To determine the potential pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. The active fractions of Spatholobi Caulis were further screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gelatin precipitation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were used to purify the methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis, respectively. The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity. Western blotting assay showed that co-treatment of PSC increased the expression of VEGFRs and phosphorylation of MAPKs which decreased by VRI treatment. In addition, quality evaluation experiments showed that the content of total flavonoids of PSC reached 56.36% and the main pro-angiogenic fractions of PSC were F3, F4 and F5 both in zebrafish and HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PSC presented pro-angiogenic activity both in zebrafish and HUVECs, and principal pro-angiogenic active components were likely flavonoids. Thus, the current study provided evidence for the clinical usage of Spatholobi Caulis in promoting blood circulation and removing stasis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1657, 1674], "name": "zebrafish embryos"}, "h": {"pos": [1717, 1735], "name": "defective vascular"}}

AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of present study is to evaluate the effect of MPF on CPID in the chronic pelvic inflammation (CPI) rat model and elucidate its possible anti-inflammatory mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CPI in rats was induced by administration with E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus. MPF (8.112g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage), 4.056g/(kg d) (10 times of adult dosage) and 2.028g/(kg d) (5 times of adult dosage)) and Jingangteng Capsule 2g/(kg d) (20 times of adult dosage) were administered orally for 20 days. The serum levels of five inflammation-associated cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1)) were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and the mRNA expression levels of TGF-β(1), P53, Fas, FasL and MMP-2 in the uterus tissue were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry assay and the pathological changes induced in the uterus and ovary tissues were observed by histology. RESULTS: MPF caused a reduction in serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β(1). The expression of P53 mRNA, Fas/FasL mRNA and MMP-2 mRNA in the uterus tissue was significantly elevated after treating with MPF, in contrast the expression of TGF-β(1) mRNA was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB p65 in uterus and ovary tissue was inhibited after treating with MPF.

It is therefore presumed that JFP could be used for the therapy of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) but the assumed efficacy has not been fully substantiated in experiment. AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, JFP was validated to regulate the mRNA expression of FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, MMP3, MMP13 and COX-2 and decrease the release of IL-17A and the protein expression of IL-6 and suppress the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in CTX induced POI rats.

Mechanistically, the LN suppressed IL-1β induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway cascades. Meanwhile, it was also demonstrated in our molecular docking studies that LN had strong binding abilities to PI3K. In addition, LN was observed exerting protective effects in a surgical induced model of OA.

METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine suggests that Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae nourishes and protects the kidneys, the effect of which is enhanced following a salt treatment. Raw and salt-processed Achyranthes bidentata are produced via different processing techniques from the same crude Achyranthes root. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of this plant have been verified earlier. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the renal-protective effects. AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels. Notably, they increased ERα, ERβ, and GPR30 in the renal tissues of AKI mice and LPS non-treated mice. In the subsequent experiments, it was found that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts increased the uterine coefficient in sexually immature mice, improved the LPS-induced decrease in NRK52e cell viability, and reduced the apoptosis, which could be antagonized by ICI182, 780 (estrogen receptor-unspecific antagonist, Faslodex). CONCLUSIONS: The renal-protective effect of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes was exhibited through antiapoptotic and antioxidant mechanisms via an estrogen-like pathway, along with a modulation of the inflammatory response by regulating immune cells.

Apoptotic phenotypes, such as cleaved PARP and caspase-3, and oxidative stress in etoposide-treated cells were ameliorated by SCE treatment. In MCAO-reperfusion injury, SCE promoted neuronal survival and level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by reducing glial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex.

{"text": "AB：OBJECTIVE: In traditional Chinese medicine, the herbal pair, Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae (RAB) and Eucommiae Cortex (EC), is widely used to treat osteoporosis. Herein, we determined whether this herbal pair can be used to ameliorate glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and find its optimal dosage in zebrafish. METHODS: The characteristics of the aqueous extract of RAB and EC were separately characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography. Osteoporosis was induced in 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish larvae by exposing them to 10 μmol/L dexamethasone (Dex) for 96 h. Seven combinations of different ratios of RAB and EC were co-administered. Treatment efficacy was determined by calculating zebrafish vertebral area and sum brightness, via alizarin red staining, and by detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the optimal dosage ratio. RESULTS: According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), β-ecdysone (β-Ecd) is a major bioactive marker in RAB extract, while pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) is the major marker in EC extract. Both of β-Ecd and PDG content values aligned with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. Treatment with 10 μmol/L Dex reduced zebrafish vertebral area, sum brightness, and ALP activity, but RAB and EC attenuated these effects. Combining 50 µg/mL RAB and 50 µg/mL EC was optimal for preventing GIOP in zebrafish. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes. A treatment of 10 μmol/L Dex decreased runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), bone γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP), and β-catenin levels. This effect was counteracted by RAB and EC co-treatment (P < 0.05). Additionally, the effect of using the two herbal extracts together was better than single-herb treatments separately. These results demonstrated that RAB and EC preserve osteoblast function in the presence of GC. The best mass ratio was 1:1.

Topical application of a Chinese herbal paste for relieving OA knee pain can be effective and safe. However, evidence-based scientific research is insufficient to support its application worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of a topical Chinese herbal paste on relieving OA knee pain and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: An OA rat model was developed by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) followed by treadmill running. A herbal paste including Dipsaci Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Eucommiae Cortex and Psoraleae Fructus, named as DAEP, was applied topically on the knee joint of the rats (DAEP). The rats without DAEP treatment served as Control. Rats with surgery but without ACLT, treadmill running and DAEP treatment acted as Sham. The morphologic change of the knee joint was observed radiographically. Nociception from the knee of the rats was assessed using Incapacitent test and CatWalk gait system. The therapeutic mechanism was investigated by analyzing the gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers via qPCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Radiographic images showed less destruction at the posterior tibial plateau of the DAEP group compared with the Control after 2 weeks of treatment. The static weight ratio and the gait parameters of the Control were reduced significantly via Incapacitance test and CatWalk gait analysis, respectively.

MLN is generally used to treat the syndrome of blood stasis in clinical practice. PURPOSE: To observe the alleviation of MLN on NASH in vivo, and explore the possible underlying mechanism. Furthermore, this study also aims to find which Chinese medicinal drug contained in MLN exerts the main pharmacological activity. METHODS: NASH model was induced in mice by feeding with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet. The effects of MLN on hepatic lipids accumulation, liver inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, and the expression of some molecules were investigated by histological observation, biochemical index analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Network pharmacology was applied to predict those involved molecular targets and potential mechanisms, which was further validated in vivo. BODIPY fluorescence staining assay was used to detect cellular lipids accumulation. RESULTS: MLN (7.8, 23.4 ml/kg) improved NASH in MCD-fed mice. Network pharmacology results demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway was crucially involved in the MLN-provided alleviation on NASH. Further experimental validation results showed that MLN increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and restored the decreased expression of nuclear PPARα in MCD-fed mice. Further results displayed that Achyranthis bidentatae radix and Lonicerae japonicae flos contributed greatly to the MLN-provided alleviation on NASH in vivo. BODIPY fluorescence staining assay showed that 25R-inokosterone and cynaroside, two compounds from Achyranthis bidentatae radix and Lonicerae japonicae flos, obviously reduced intracellular lipids accumulation in hepatocytes stimulated by non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA).

The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

Moreover, ABPP preconditioning significantly inhibited superoxide generation, gp91phox expression, malonaldialdehyde formation and enhanced superoxide dismutase activity in I/R hearts. Furthermore, ABPP treatment inhibited PTEN expression and increased Akt phosphorylation in I/R rat heart. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked Akt activation, and abolished ABPP-stimulated anti-oxidant effect and cardioprotection.

In addition, the main bioactive components of total alkaloids were to be identified and analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method was used to identify and quantify the major components in the TALH extract. The wound healing activity was evaluated in vivo using a rat full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Histological study of wound healing in rat model was performed via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Wound healing and transwell assays were used for detection of cell migration. The effect on tube formation was determined by tube formation assay in HUVECs. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to detect the expressions of relative proteins and genes respectively. Knock-down of SRC by siRNA was done to verify the crucial role of SRC in promotion of angiogenesis induced by TALH. RESULTS: Seven characteristic peaks were recognized in the UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS spectrum, while four of the main components were quantified. The wound model in rats showed that treatment of TALH promoted wound healing by stimulating cellular proliferation and collagen deposition. In vitro experiments showed that co-treatment of TALH and VEGF increased cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Mechanistic studies suggested that the co-treatment increased gene expressions of SRC, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as well as the phosphorylation levels of these proteins.

METHODS: We established a rat SONFH model by injecting Methylprednisolone (MPS) into the right gluteus muscle 30 mg/kg/d, 3 days of continuous injection every week, 4 weeks in total. According to the clinical dosage of BSHXC (Herba epimedium 3 g, Eucommia ulmoides 15 g, Salvia miltiorrhizae 30 g, Chuanxiong 15 g, Paeonia lactiflora Pall 15 g, Poria cocos 12 g, Achyranthes bidentata 12 g, antler gum 10 g, Cyperus rotundus L. Nine g and Radix Glycyrrhizae 9 g), it was converted into the equivalent dose of rats, and gavage was performed at the weight of 10 mL/kg, once per day. The BSHXC was subjected to experiments in vivo, SONFH pharmacodynamics, bioinformatics, and network of pharmacology to determine the active ingredients, and its protective role against SONFH, Enrichment analysis was performed to explore the possible mechanism of BSHXC, and cell experiments were undertaken to analyze the impact of BSHXC on the hormones associated with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) between osteogenesis and apoptosis. RESULTS: Experiments confirmed that BSHXC could effectively reduce bone loss in SONFH rat models. From bioinformatics and a network constructed from 10 drugs-208 pharmacology-126 targets, the enrichment analysis showed that the core targets were inflammatory reaction, steroid hormones, estrogen receptors, osteoporosis, and adjustment of osteogenesis and osteoclast differentiation, among others. The cell proliferation and staining supported that the mechanism of BSHXC promoted osteogenesis and intervening in apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The BSHXC reduced the inflammatory response, changed steroid response, regulated estrogen receptors, delayed osteoporosis, regulated osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation by regulating related targets, and improved the local microenvironment by a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-link process to delay or reverse the progression of SONFH.", "relation": "is part of", "t": {"pos": [700, 705], "name": "BSHXC"}, "h": {"pos": [872, 882], "name": "antler gum"}}

Western blot and immunofluorescent assays were used to examine the expression of protein related to the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed to determine the interaction between p-STAT3 and NOX4. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model, we found that treatment with SCM-198 could ameliorate neuron morphology and reduce the degenerating cell and neuron loss.

In this study, the role of leonurine (LN), a traditional Chinese medicine isolated from Herba leonuri, in promoting angiogenesis and its function in wound healing have been investigated. The results of co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that LN treatment (5-20 μM) could promote the proliferation and migration and enhance the ability of in vitro angiogenesis through up-regulating the mTOR/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, a full-thickness cutaneous wound model was used to investigate the healing effect of LN in vivo. Intragastric administration of 20 mg per kg per day LN stimulated the regeneration of more blood vessels at the wound sites, which confirmed the in vitro results of promoting angiogenesis. Due to fast vascularization, the collagen matrix deposition and remodeling processes were also accelerated in LN treated wounds, resulting in efficient wound healing. In summary, LN promoted angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro by activating the mTOR/ERK pathway, and could efficiently enhance the angiogenesis and collagen deposition of the regenerated tissue, together with facilitating the wound healing process in vivo.

Furthermore, ethanol extracts were partitioned successively with four kinds of solvents, and the anti-inflammatory parts were selected by the same vitro model. Subsequently, mice were arbitrarily divided into control, CIA model, positive control, effective parts alone or in combination. After 20 days of oral administration, the weight, hind paw volume, rheumatism index value, and the pathological changes were checked to assess the obvious level of arthritis. Furthermore, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-17A in serum and the balance of Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) was detected. Finally, the major active constituents were identified. RESULTS: In vitro, the anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts was much better than water extract.

However, treatment of motherwort ethanol extract in vivo markedly suppressed the development of uterine adenomyosis and mammary cancers in mice. Therefore, anti-cancer activity of Chinese motherwort, especially in a form of ethanol extract, needs to be confirmed further at cellular level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aerial part of Chinese motherwort (Leonurus japonicus Houtt) dry powder is extracted with 70% ethanol and the chemical components were characterized with HPLC finger print as well as mass spectrometry.

{"text": "AB：There are reports of early evidence that suggest the involvement of chronic low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. Thus, substances that have effects in reducing inflammation could be potential drugs for Type 2 diabetes. Leonurine (4-guanidino-n-butyl syringate; SCM-198) is an alkaloid in HL (Herba leonuri), which was reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesize that SCM-198 may have beneficial effects on Type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we attempted to test this hypothesis by evaluating the anti-diabetic effect of SCM-198 and the possible underlying mechanisms of its effects in db/db mice. SCM-198 (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight), pioglitazone (50 mg/kg of body weight, as a positive control) or 1% CMC-Na (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) were administered to the db/db or db/m mice once daily for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, SCM-198 (200 mg/kg of body weight) treatment significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose level and increased the plasma insulin concentration in the db/db mice, meanwhile it significantly lowered the plasma TAG (triacylglycerol) concentration and increased the HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol concentration. Moreover, the dysregulated transcription of the hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes, including GK (glucokinase), G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase) and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), was recovered by an Akt-dependent pathway. The pro-inflammatory mediators {such as TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α), IL (interleukin)-6, IL-1β, degradation of IκB [inhibitor of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)] α and thereafter activation of NF-κB} were reversed by SCM-198 treatment in the db/db mice. The present study provides first evidence that SCM-198 exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and has an ameliorating effect on diabetic symptoms via inhibiting of NF-κB/IKK (IκB kinase) pathway.

Emerging evidence indicates that leonurine produces neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of leonurine in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially in major depression, remains unknown. METHODS: We used the chronic mild stress mouse model to explore the antidepressant effects of leonurine and the potential mechanisms. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail suspension test were taken to evaluate depression symptoms. Moreover, the contents of monoamine neurotransmitters in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Neuronal morphology was detected by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Administration of leonurine (60 mg/kg) for 4 weeks significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors of chronic mild stress mice, including increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test. We further found that leonurine (60 mg/kg) effectively restored the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, and dopamine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of chronic mild stress mice, accompanied by amelioration of hippocampal neuronal damage. Furthermore, leonurine (60 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and TNF-α, and suppressed the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells. In comparison, pretreatment with ABPS did not alter the number of natural Treg or the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased. The number of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg gradually increased as the dose of catechin increased and the time of administration prolonged. CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg of the high-dose catechin group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01) and reached the maximum at the seventh day after administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that catechin extracted from the active acetic ether part of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn can regulate hematopoiesis by inducing bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM of mice.

{"text": "AB：BACKGROUND: Clinical immunity to malaria in human populations is developed after repeated exposure to malaria. Regulation and balance of host immune responses may lead to optimal immunity against malaria parasite infection. Polysaccharides (ABPS) derived from the Chinese herb ox knee Achyranthes bidentata possess immuno-modulatory functions. The aim of this study is to use the rodent malaria model Plasmodium yoelii 17XL (P. y17XL) to examine whether pretreatment with ABPS will modulate host immunity against malaria infection and improve the outcome of the disease. METHODS: To determine whether ABPS could modulate immunity against malaria, mice were pretreated with ABPS prior to blood-stage infection by P. y17XL. Host survival and parasitaemia were monitored daily. The effect of pretreatment on host immune responses was studied through the quantitation of cytokines, dendritic cell populations, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). RESULTS: Pretreatment with ABPS prior to infection significantly extended the survival time of mice after P. y17XL infection. At three and five days post-infection, ABPS pretreated mice developed stronger Th1 immune responses against malaria infection with the number of F4/80+CD36+ macrophages and levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and nitric oxide being significantly higher than in the control group. More importantly, ABPS-treated mice developed more myeloid (CD11c+CD11b+) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD11c+CD45R+/B220+) than control mice. ABPS pretreatment also resulted in modulated expression of MHC-II, CD86, and especially Toll-like receptor 9 by CD11c+ dendritic cells. In comparison, pretreatment with ABPS did not alter the number of natural Treg or the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with the immuno-modulatory ABPS selectively enhanced Th1 immune responses to control the proliferation of malaria parasites, and prolonged the survival of mice during subsequent malaria infection.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [1942, 1982], "name": "mice during subsequent malaria infection"}, "h": {"pos": [1930, 1938], "name": "survival"}}

The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of LE on MF, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. A mouse model of MI was established, followed by administration of LE for 4 weeks. We found that LE effectively improved cardiac function, and attenuated fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in mice post-MI. In vitro, LE simultaneously inhibited proliferation and migration of neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), and the activation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblast generation was markedly suppressed by LE. Notably, we found that all mature miR-29 family members were downregulated in the myocardial tissues of mice post-MI, whereas LE significantly upregulated miR-29a-3p expression, and such upregulation was also detected in LE-treated CFs under Ang II stimulation. Knockdown of miR-29a-3p by a specific miRNA inhibitor upregulated the protein levels of TGF-β, collagen III, and collagen I in CFs, and completely reversed the antifibrotic effects of LE on CFs.

Furthermore, this study also aims to find which Chinese medicinal drug contained in MLN exerts the main pharmacological activity. METHODS: NASH model was induced in mice by feeding with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet. The effects of MLN on hepatic lipids accumulation, liver inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, and the expression of some molecules were investigated by histological observation, biochemical index analysis, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Network pharmacology was applied to predict those involved molecular targets and potential mechanisms, which was further validated in vivo. BODIPY fluorescence staining assay was used to detect cellular lipids accumulation. RESULTS: MLN (7.8, 23.4 ml/kg) improved NASH in MCD-fed mice. Network pharmacology results demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway was crucially involved in the MLN-provided alleviation on NASH. Further experimental validation results showed that MLN increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and restored the decreased expression of nuclear PPARα in MCD-fed mice. Further results displayed that Achyranthis bidentatae radix and Lonicerae japonicae flos contributed greatly to the MLN-provided alleviation on NASH in vivo. BODIPY fluorescence staining assay showed that 25R-inokosterone and cynaroside, two compounds from Achyranthis bidentatae radix and Lonicerae japonicae flos, obviously reduced intracellular lipids accumulation in hepatocytes stimulated by non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA).

METHODS: The characteristics of the aqueous extract of RAB and EC were separately characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography. Osteoporosis was induced in 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish larvae by exposing them to 10 μmol/L dexamethasone (Dex) for 96 h. Seven combinations of different ratios of RAB and EC were co-administered. Treatment efficacy was determined by calculating zebrafish vertebral area and sum brightness, via alizarin red staining, and by detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the optimal dosage ratio. RESULTS: According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), β-ecdysone (β-Ecd) is a major bioactive marker in RAB extract, while pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) is the major marker in EC extract. Both of β-Ecd and PDG content values aligned with the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. Treatment with 10 μmol/L Dex reduced zebrafish vertebral area, sum brightness, and ALP activity, but RAB and EC attenuated these effects.

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A rat model of inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis-induced DVT and a cell model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were performed. Rats were orally administered with SCDG solution once daily for seven consecutive days. IVC stenosis-induced DVT was operated on the sixth day. Thrombi were harvested and weighed on the seventh day. Pathological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β of serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with turbidimetric immunoassay. Protein expressions in thrombosed IVCs and/or OGD-stimulated EA. hy926 cells were evaluated by western blot and/or immunofluorescence analyses. RESULTS: SCDG dramatically decreased thrombus weight. SCDG decreased tissue factor (TF) protein expression, inflammatory cells influxes in thrombosed vein wall and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and CRP. Further, SCDG up-regulated Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein expression and down-regulated acetylated-NF-κB p65 (Ace-p65) protein expression. Moreover, SCDG up-regulated nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions, and down-regulated phosphorylated-NF-κB p65 (p-p65) protein expression. In the OGD cell model, SCDG medicated serum decreased the protein expression of TF. SCDG medicated serum enhanced SIRT1 protein expression and reduced Ace-p65 nuclear protein expression. SCDG medicated serum promoted protein expressions of nuclear Nrf2 and total HO-1, and inhibited translocation of p65. Furthermore, inhibiting SIRT1 and Nrf2 reversed the protective effect of SCDG medicated serum on OGD-induced EA. hy926 cells. CONCLUSION: SCDG may prevent DVT through antiinflammation via SIRT1 and Nrf2.", "relation": "has therapeutic effect on", "t": {"pos": [143, 164], "name": "blood stasis syndrome"}, "h": {"pos": [78, 100], "name": "Spatholobi Caulis (SC)"}}

The aim of this study was to identify the antimutagenic components from extracts of S. suberectus against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 and to elucidate the antimutagenic mechanism of the flavonoids. RESULTS: From the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from fractionation of the methanol extract of S. suberectus Dunn, medicarpin, formononetin and isoliquiritigenin were successfully isolated through a combination of normal- and reversed-phase chromatography. Genistein and naringenin, which were already reported to be contained in S. suberectus Dunn, were also tested for their antimutagenicity towards MNU, along with formononetin, isoliquiritigenin and medicarpin. Our results demonstrated that genistein, isoliquiritigenin, medicarpin and naringenin were antimutagenic against MNU without showing cytotoxicity. MNU is reported to cause not only DNA alkylation but also induce reactive oxygen species. The hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of the flavonoids was correlated with the antimutagenic capacity, indicating that the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was involved in their antimutagenicity towards MNU. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to prevent DNA damage by N-nitrosamines for cancer chemoprevention.

Achyranthis bidentatae radix (ABR) is designed as a lower-guiding drug in SMW to augment the articular accumulation of active ingredients and improve the anti-inflammatory effect. AIM OF THE STUDY: Present study was undertaken to investigate the dose-response relationship of berberine in SMW between the articular concentration and anti-inflammatory effect in the knee joint under the lower-guiding of ABR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into control group, model group and SMW without or with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups. Rat model of acute gouty arthritis (AGA) was established by intra-articular injection of 0.2 mL monosodium urate crystal (20 mg/mL) inside knee joint cavity on day 2 during drug treatment slots. Knee joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were investigated for anti-inflammatory study. The concentrations of berberine in rat plasma and tissues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS method. The effect of ABR on the expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR1 mRNA in the synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats was examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR assay, respectively. RESULTS: The distribution of berberine increased by 6.53%, 44.31% and 212.96% in the knee joint and 474.93%, 631.01% and 1063.3% in the ankle for SMW with low, medium and high doses of ABR groups, compared with SMW without ABR group. Similarly, the plasma level of berberine increased by 19.81%, 143.4% and 681.13%. On the contrary, the distribution of berberine evidently decreased 3.23, 10.61 and 46.21-fold in heart and 3.68, 6.74 and 24.78-fold in lung. SMW with different doses of ABR groups exhibited better efficiency than SMW without ABR group on ameliorating knee joint swelling, inhibiting synovial hyperplasia and alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration of AGA rats. The treatment with ABR could down-regulate the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expressions of synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced articular distribution of berberine in SMW was attributed to the lower-guiding effect of ABR, which could evidently increase the plasma concentration of berberine, improve the supply of blood of inflamed joint, reduce the distribution of berberine in heart and lung and significantly inhibit the MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression of synovial tissues of knee joints in AGA rats.

To understand endothelium-independent vasodilation, the effects of herb elements on agonists-induced vasocontractility and on the contraction of endothelium-free aortic rings exposed to a Ca(2+)-free medium were examined. Furthermore, the role of nitric oxide signaling in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was also evaluated. In summary, FGR and FSC exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects compared to CPR and SAA. FGR exerts the strongest vasodilatory effect, while CPR shows the least. The relaxation induced by SAA and FSC required intact endothelia. The mechanism of this vasodilation might involve eNOS.

Apoptotic phenotypes, such as cleaved PARP and caspase-3, and oxidative stress in etoposide-treated cells were ameliorated by SCE treatment. In MCAO-reperfusion injury, SCE promoted neuronal survival and level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by reducing glial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex.

Here, we investigated the potential effects of stachydrine hydrochloride, a bioactive constituent extracted from the Chinese herb Leonurus japonicus Houtt. (Yimucao), on pathological cardiac hypertrophy during chronic α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) activation and the underlying mechanisms. First, by transcriptome analysis, we determined that pathological hypertrophy models could be prepared after phenylephrine stimulation. In primary cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, stachydrine hydrochloride reduced phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte surface area and the mRNA expression of cardiac hypertrophy biomarkers (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and β-myosin heavy chain/α-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC/α-MHC)).

Interestingly, stachydrine hydrochloride inhibited CaN activation and reduced NFATc3 nuclear translocation in phenylephrine-stimulated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. In mice treated with phenylephrine, stachydrine hydrochloride treatment decreased cardiac hypertrophy and regulated heart function. Collectively, our data show that stachydrine hydrochloride decreases cardiac hypertrophy in phenylephrine-stimulated hearts by inhibiting the CaN/NFAT pathway, which might contribute to alleviation of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction by stachydrine hydrochloride after phenylephrine stimulation This also indicated that governing of CaN/NFAT pathway might serve as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.", "relation": "in", "t": {"pos": [577, 627], "name": "primary cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes"}, "h": {"pos": [685, 711], "name": "cardiomyocyte surface area"}}

Stachydrine hydrochloride, the main bioactive ingredient extracted from Leonurus japonicus Houtt., has been shown to have cardioprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of stachydrine hydrochloride haven't been comprehensively studied so far. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of stachydrine hydrochloride in heart failure and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, transverse aorta constriction was carried out in C57BL/6J mice, and thereafter, 7.2 mg/kg telmisartan (a selective AT1R antagonist as positive control) and 12 mg/kg stachydrine hydrochloride was administered daily intragastrically for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by assessing morphological changes as well as echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters. In vitro, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult mice cardiomyocytes were treated with stachydrine hydrochloride and challenged with phenylephrine (α-AR agonist). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of C57BL/6J mice by Langendorff crossflow perfusion system. Intracellular calcium was measured by an ion imaging system. The length and movement of sarcomere were traced to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of single myocardial cells. RESULTS: Stachydrine hydrochloride improved the cardiac function and calcium transient amplitudes, and inhibited the SR leakage and the amount of sparks in cardiac myocytes isolated from TAC mice. We also demonstrated that stachydrine hydrochloride could ameliorated phenylephrine-induced enhance in sarcomere contraction, calcium transients and calcium sparks. Moreover, our data shown that stachydrine hydrochloride blocked the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII, RyR2, PLN, and prevented the disassociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2.

The proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells must rely on the existence and stimulation of HGF. This study investigated the effect of catechin, an active component extracted from Spatholobus suberectus Dunn (SSD), on bioactivity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA), burst-promoting activity (BPA) and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity (MK-CSA) in spleen condition medium (SPCM) of mice to clarify the hematopoietic mechanism of catechin and SSD. METHODS: Spleen cells of mice were separated and spleen condition medium (SPCM) was prepared from spleen cell culture. Bone marrow cells of mice were separated and cultured in a culture system including 10% (v/v) SPCM (induced by catechin in vivo or ex vivo) for 6 days. Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-colony-forming units (BFU-E) and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) formation were employed to assay the effects of different treatment on the bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. RESULTS: SPCM induced by 100 mg/L catechin ex vivo could promote the growth of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-Meg, which indicated that catechin could stimulate the production of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in SPCM. SPCM prepared at the fourth day of spleen cell culture showed the best stimulating activity. The bioactivity of GM-CSA, BPA and MK-CSA in the SPCM prepared after intraperitoneally injecting catechin into mice was also increased.

The rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet received treatments of low, moderate, and high doses of SCM-198 and placebo concurrently. Eight weeks later, the animals underwent ultrasonographic imaging. They were then sacrificed for further pathological and molecular biological analysis. RESULTS: SCM-198-treated rabbits showed a significant alleviation in the development of atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. The lesions were smaller after the SCM-198 treatments. In addition, the elasticity of the arteries and hemodynamic status improved, accompanied with a decrease in smooth muscle cell migration and, macrophage infiltration, as well as the expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in the aortas. Marginal changes in the lipid parameters were found in the SCM-198-treated rabbits, with high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C) elevation and triglyceride (TG) reduction at the high dose.

This study was designed to investigate the cecal microbiota in chickens and to elucidate the immune mechanism involved in the CSP effect on CY induced-immunosuppressed chickens. A total of 288 cocks were equally divided into six groups and used to evaluate the immune effect of CSP. Results showed that the CSP increased the body weight and immune organ index of immunosuppressed chickens, significantly increased the secretion of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) in sera of chickens, and restored the body immune function. The CSP reduced intestinal injury of the jejunum and ileum, increased the ratio of the intestinal villus height to crypt depth (V/C), improved the expression of tight junction protein, and protected intestinal health. The CSP activated the toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and enhanced the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, Claudin1, and Zo-1, protecting the intestinal tract. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene showed that CSP increased species richness, restored CY-induced intestinal microbiome imbalance, and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillus in the intestinal tract.

The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of this plant and the anti-cancer action of the combinatorial treatment of S. tamariscina and doxorubicin have not yet been investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: We evaluated the inhibitory activity of S. tamariscina extract (STE) and its major compound, amentoflavone, on human aldo-keto reductase family 1B10 (AKR1B10), which is a detoxification enzyme involved in drug resistance, to evaluate their anti-cancer effects and their potential as adjuvant agents for doxorubicin cancer chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the AKR1B10 inhibitory activity of STE and amentoflavone via an in vitro biochemical assay using recombinant human AKR1B10. We tested the anti-proliferative activity in A549, NCI-H460, SKOV-3, and MCF-7 human cancer cells, which contain different expression levels of AKR1B10, and determined the combination index to evaluate whether the addition of STE and amentoflavone is synergistic or antagonistic to the anti-cancer action of doxorubicin. We finally evaluated the in vivo anti-tumor effects of STE in a nude mouse xenograft model of A549 cells. RESULTS: STE and amentoflavone potently inhibited human AKR1B10 and synergistically increased the doxorubicin anti-proliferative effect in A549 and NCI-H460 human lung cancer cells that express a high level of AKR1B10 mRNA and protein. STE also significantly inhibited A549 tumor growth in animal experiments.

SSD treatment exerted cytotoxicity in U266 and U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, apoptosis-related proteins such as PARP, procaspase-3, and Bax were regulated by SSD treatment. Furthermore, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed that a number of apoptotic bodies were increased by SSD. Interestingly, the ER stress-related proteins such as p-ATF2 and CHOP were elevated by SSD. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxicity by SSD treatment were significantly reduced by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Among the microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by SSD treatment, miR-657 was most significantly reduced by SSD treatment. However, an miR-657 mimic reversed SSD-induced apoptosis by the attenuation of the expression of p-ATF2, CHOP, and PARP cleavage.

It is therefore presumed that JFP could be used for the therapy of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) but the assumed efficacy has not been fully substantiated in experiment. AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate the effectiveness of JFP on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced POI and preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms of action. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental rat model of POI was established by using CTX induction to assess the efficacy of JFP. The potential targets of action for JFP alleviating POI were predicted by the combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomics and finally validating by RT-qPCR and Western blot. RESULTS: JFP alleviated the damages of ovarian tissue induced by CTX in the rat model of POI via significantly decreasing serum levels of FSH and LH and the ratio of FSH/LH and increasing the levels of E2 and AMH, accompanied with promoting ovarian folliculogenesis and follicle maturity and reversing the depletion of follicle pool. With the analysis of network pharmacology, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-AKT, TNF and FoxO signaling pathways were predicted to be influenced by JFP. The results of RNA-seq further revealed that IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway regulated by both CTX and JFP, following by transcriptional misregulation in cancer and proteoglycans in cancer. Combining the two analytical methods, JFP likely targeted genes associated with immune regulation, including COX-2, HSP90AA1, FOS, MMP3 and MAPK11 and pathways, including IL-17,Th17 cell differentiation and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, JFP was validated to regulate the mRNA expression of FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, MMP3, MMP13 and COX-2 and decrease the release of IL-17A and the protein expression of IL-6 and suppress the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in CTX induced POI rats.

After 3 weeks, SCM-198 (200 mg/kg of body weight) treatment significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose level and increased the plasma insulin concentration in the db/db mice, meanwhile it significantly lowered the plasma TAG (triacylglycerol) concentration and increased the HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol concentration. Moreover, the dysregulated transcription of the hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes, including GK (glucokinase), G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase) and PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), was recovered by an Akt-dependent pathway.

In HaCaT cells, the production of proinflammatory chemokines induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was inhibited by SSWex pretreatment. SSWex treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and activation and translocation of transcriptional factors, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor kappa B in IFN-γ/TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells.

As an alkaloid extracted from Herba leonuri, leonurine (LE) has been found to be an effective natural active ingredient for inhibiting fibrosis in many preclinical experiments. However, whether LE protects against MF after MI through modifying miR-29 remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of LE on MF, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. A mouse model of MI was established, followed by administration of LE for 4 weeks. We found that LE effectively improved cardiac function, and attenuated fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in mice post-MI. In vitro, LE simultaneously inhibited proliferation and migration of neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), and the activation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblast generation was markedly suppressed by LE. Notably, we found that all mature miR-29 family members were downregulated in the myocardial tissues of mice post-MI, whereas LE significantly upregulated miR-29a-3p expression, and such upregulation was also detected in LE-treated CFs under Ang II stimulation. Knockdown of miR-29a-3p by a specific miRNA inhibitor upregulated the protein levels of TGF-β, collagen III, and collagen I in CFs, and completely reversed the antifibrotic effects of LE on CFs.

The mRNA level of PapG in CFT073 was used to test the influence of SVCP on virulence factor. The effects of SVCP on the inhibition of bacterial adhesion were evaluated with mice UTI model. RESULTS: In the rat UTI model, the levels of bacterial load, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) in urine and the pathological injury in the bladder were significantly up-regulated, the expression of PIGR in kidney was down-regulated, no significant change was observed on the pro-inflammatory cytokines in urine. After oral administration of SVCP for 3 days, the levels of bacterial load, WBC and RBC in urine were significantly decreased, the pathological injury in the bladder were remarkably inhibited. The expression of IL-6, IL-8 in urine and PIGR in kidney were significantly up-regulated by SVCP (200 mg/kg). SVCP showed no effect on the concentration of PCT in serum. SVCP failed to down-regulate the mRNA level of PapG in CFT073. In the mice UTI model, pre-treatment of SVCP failed to inhibit the intracellular bacterial load in the bladder.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were isolated from 4-weeks-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The cytocompatibility of leonurine on rBMSCs was tested via CCK-8 assays and flow cytometric analyses. The effects of leonurine on rBMSC osteogenic differentiation were analyzed via ALP staining, Alizarin red staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blot. Additionally, autophagy-related markers were examined via qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses of rBMSCs during osteogenic differentiation with leonurine and with or without 3-methyladenine (3-MA) as an autophagic inhibitor. Finally, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was evaluated during rBMSC osteogenesis. RESULTS: Leonurine at 2-100 μM promoted the proliferation of rBMSCs. ALP and Alizarin red staining results showed that 10 μM leonurine promoted rBMSC osteoblastic differentiation, which was consistent with the qRT-PCR and Western blot results.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of leonurine on cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice, and further determine the potential mechanisms. METHODS: Human THP-1 cells were fully differentiated into foam cells by the pre-treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and oxidized density lipoproteins (ox-LDL). After cells were incubated with various concentrations of leonurine, Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays were utilized to detect cellular lipid accumulation and cholesterol content, respectively. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively.

The atherosclerotic lesion sizes and collagen contents in aortic roots were determined by Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining and liquid scintillation counting assays showed that leonurine significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and promoted 3H-cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, both the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1/G1, PPARγ and LXRα were enhanced by leonurine, which were attenuated by LXRα siRNA or PPARγ siRNA transfection. Finally, leonurine improved plasma lipid profile, decreased atherosclerotic lesion sizes, increased collagen contents and amplified PPARγ, LXRα and ABCA1/G1 expressions in aortic roots of apoE-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Leonurine can promote cholesterol efflux and alleviate cellular lipid accumulation by magnifying the expression of ABCA1/G1 in a PPARγ/LXRα signaling pathway-dependent manner in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and abate atherogenesis in apoE-/- mice, which may offer a promising therapeutic intervention of leonurine in protecting against AS.", "relation": "promote", "t": {"pos": [2123, 2127], "name": "LXRα"}, "h": {"pos": [1993, 2002], "name": "leonurine"}}

The aim of this study was to identify the antimutagenic components from extracts of S. suberectus against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 and to elucidate the antimutagenic mechanism of the flavonoids. RESULTS: From the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from fractionation of the methanol extract of S. suberectus Dunn, medicarpin, formononetin and isoliquiritigenin were successfully isolated through a combination of normal- and reversed-phase chromatography. Genistein and naringenin, which were already reported to be contained in S. suberectus Dunn, were also tested for their antimutagenicity towards MNU, along with formononetin, isoliquiritigenin and medicarpin. Our results demonstrated that genistein, isoliquiritigenin, medicarpin and naringenin were antimutagenic against MNU without showing cytotoxicity. MNU is reported to cause not only DNA alkylation but also induce reactive oxygen species. The hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of the flavonoids was correlated with the antimutagenic capacity, indicating that the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was involved in their antimutagenicity towards MNU.

Exposing H9c2 cells to H₂O₂ significantly decreased cell viability, and this was attenuated by pretreatment with leonurine for 4 h in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, leonurine was found to reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in H₂O₂-stimulated cell. Moreover, H9c2 cells stimulated by H₂O₂ was accompanied with apparent apoptotic characteristics, including fragmentation of DNA, apoptotic body formation, release of cytochrome c, translocation of Bax to mitochondria, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) and activation of caspase 3. Furthermore, H₂O₂ also induced rapid and significant phosphorylation of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), which was inhibited SP600125 (a JNK1/2 inhibitor).

Methods: Peripheral blood from HDs and MM patients was isolated for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The generation of moDCs was conducted by the incubation of monocytes from PBMCs in the medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 5% human serum, 800 U/mL GM-CSF, 500 U/mL IL-4, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. During the incubation of 7 days, the cells were administrated with 1 μM leonurine or 1 × PBS as the control group. On the 8th day, cells were harvested. The expression of maturation associated surface markers CD40, CD83, and HLA-DR on moDCs was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Pretreatment with SCM198 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM) concentration-dependently increased the cell viability as measured in MTT and LDH leakage assays compared with 6-OHDA-injured cells. Tocopherol, an antioxidant used as positive control, had similar effect at 10 μM to SCM198 1 μM. Furthermore, we assessed oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis, the critical players in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with 0.1, 1, and 10 μM of SCM198 in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 6-OHDA. Pretreatment with SCM198 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity, ameliorated intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, prevented the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased apoptotic cell death in Hoechst 33258 staining, as well as down-regulated Bax and up-regulated Bcl-2 in both mRNA and protein levels compared with 6-OHDA damaged cells. Moreover, intragastrical administration of SCM198 (18 or 60 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹) for 4 weeks significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. These results support the neuroprotective effects of SCM198 against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in vivo and in vitro with the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis.

However, the pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis was not well elucidated AIM OF STUDY: To determine the potential pro-angiogenic activity of Spatholobi Caulis and elucidate its underlying mechanism. The active fractions of Spatholobi Caulis were further screened. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gelatin precipitation and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were used to purify the methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis, respectively. The RPLC was also used to prepare fractions. Total flavonoids of purified methanol extracts of Spatholobi Caulis (PSC) were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The morphological observation of subintestinal vessel plexus (SIVs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor II (VRI)-induced intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) loss in transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli-1a: EGFP)y1 were selected to evaluate the pro-angiogenic activity of PSC in vivo. Cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell migration assay were used to evaluate the pro-angiogenesis effect of PSC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Both zebrafish and HUVECs were used in screening active fractions of PSC. The mechanism of PSC promoting angiogenesis were studied by real-time PCR in zebrafish and western blotting in HUVECs. RESULTS: Co-treatment PSC dramatically rescued VRI-induced ISVs loss in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner and 80% of the defective vascular recovered at the concentration of 30μg/ml compared with VRI-only group. PSC also concentration-dependently increased average sprouting number and diameter of SIVs in zebrafish embryo. Real-time PCR assay proved that PSC significantly restored the down regulation of VEGFRs including Flt-1, Kdr and Kdrl induced by VRI in zebrafish (P<0.001). Furthermore, PSC not only promoted proliferation and migration of normal HUVECs but also ameliorated VRI-induced HUVECs cytotoxicity. Western blotting assay showed that co-treatment of PSC increased the expression of VEGFRs and phosphorylation of MAPKs which decreased by VRI treatment. In addition, quality evaluation experiments showed that the content of total flavonoids of PSC reached 56.36% and the main pro-angiogenic fractions of PSC were F3, F4 and F5 both in zebrafish and HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PSC presented pro-angiogenic activity both in zebrafish and HUVECs, and principal pro-angiogenic active components were likely flavonoids.

AIM: The purpose of present study is to compare the protective effects of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced acute kidney injury in mice and chemically characterize their extracts. METHOD: The monomer components of raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The aggregation and distribution of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) near infrared fluorescence probe in mice was examined with a small animal imaging systems. The pathological and morphological changes of kidneys were observed by H&E staining, and the serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were used to evaluate the renal function. The levels of cytokines in serum were detected by cytometric bead array. Flow cytometry assay was performed to assess the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney cells, and cell surface marker expression including CD45(+), F4/80(+), and Ly-6G(+). The estrogenic activities of the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes were observed by uterine weight gain test in sexually immature mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels in the kidney. RESULTS: Chemical analysis showed that the salt-processed Achyranthes contained more ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa than the raw Achyranthes, but there was no difference in the contents of β-ecdysterone, 25R-inokosterone, and 25S-inokosterone.in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging showed a significant reduced inflammation in the AKI mice. Histological studies showed that the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes markedly decreased the inflammatory infiltration, swelling and vacuolar degeneration in renal tissues and the Scr and BUN. Importantly, the raw and salt-processed Achyranthes extracts demonstrated different degrees of inhibition on the LPS-induced AKI, with salt-processed Achyranthes showing better inhibition. Results of flow cytometry showed a significant inhibition of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and promoted IL-10, along with reduced macrophages (CD45 + F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45+ Ly-6G+) and phagocytes. Furthermore, the extracts reduced the accumulation of ROS and apoptosis in the kidney, and also regulated the expression of apoptosis marker proteins TLR4, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 levels.

The expression of cathelicidin (LL-37) in human renal cell carcinoma cell line (A498) was tested after the treatment of VSP. RESULTS: In the kidneys of infection models, high-titer bacteria was detected. In the kidney of rat model, the expression of CRAMP was down-regulated, no significant change was observed in the levels of TLRs. After oral administration of VSP, the bacterial load was significantly decreased in rat and mouse models, and the levels of CRAMP and TLRs were significantly up-regulated in rat model. In vitro, the expression of LL-37 was significantly inhibited by CFT073. VSP up-regulated the expression of LL-37 in A498 cells.

Ischemic stroke which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, ultimately caused irreversible neuron damage. This study is aimed at exploring the possible therapeutic potential of SCM-198 in the protection against postischemic neuronal injury and possible underlying mechanisms. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model was utilized to measure the protective effect of SCM-198 on neurons. TEM was used to determine neuron ultrastructural changes. The brain slices were stained with Nissl staining solution for Nissl bodies. Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) was used for staining the degenerating neurons. In the oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model of bEnd.3 cells treated with SCM-198 (0.1, 1, 10 μM). Then, the bEnd.3 cells were cocultured with SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability, MDA level, CAT activity, and apoptosis were examined to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these treatments. Western blot and immunofluorescent assays were used to examine the expression of protein related to the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation was performed to determine the interaction between p-STAT3 and NOX4. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model, we found that treatment with SCM-198 could ameliorate neuron morphology and reduce the degenerating cell and neuron loss. In the in vitro model of bEnd.3 cell oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), treatment with SCM-198 restored the activity of catalase (CAT), improved the expression of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) production. SCM-198 treatment prevented OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis as indicated by increased cell viability and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, accompanied with upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein and downregulation Bax protein. The results were consistent with SH-SY5Y cells which coculture with bEnd.3 cells. The forthcoming study revealed that SCM-198 activated the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway. All the data indicated that SCM-198 protected against oxidative stress and neuronal damage in in vivo and in vitro injury models via the p-STAT3/NOX4/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.

This study is conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplemental achyranthes bidentata polysaccharide (ABP) on proliferation activity of lymphocytes, and production of antibodies, complements and cytokines in weaned piglets. Results showed that lymphocyte proliferation activity in piglets fed diets supplementing with 1000 and 1500 mg/kg ABP increased (P < 0.05) on days 14 and 28 compared with the non-additive piglets, as well as serum contents of IgG, IgA, IgM, C(3), C(4), IL (interleukin)-2 and IFN (interferon)-gamma. The ABP had dose-dependent immunomodulatory activity and the dose of 1500 mg/kg presented the strongest stimulating activity in vivo. In addition, the ABP increased (P < 0.05) the proliferation activity and production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma of cultured lymphocytes in dose- or time-dependent manner. The proliferation activity of peripheral T cells and splenic lymphocytes in 400 microg/ml of ABP group arrived at their peak values, as well as the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma at 72 and 12 h after the treatment, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggested that dietary supplementation with ABP to weaned piglets enhances cellular and humoral immune responses, and ABP addition to culture medium also increases the proliferation activity and cytokine production of lymphocytes cultured in vitro, which indicate that dietary supplementation with the herbal polysaccharide may offer an effective alternative to antibiotics for weaned piglets.", "relation": "promote", "t": {"pos": [1287, 1296], "name": "IFN-gamma"}, "h": {"pos": [1208, 1213], "name": " ABP "}}

The rat model of urinary tract infection was used and treated with PSV,and the urine and bladders were collected. The level of interleukin-10( IL-10) in rat urine was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay( ELISA). Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expressions of sonic hedgehog( SHH) and NLRP3 inflammasome [NOD-like receptor thermoprotein domain 3( NLRP3),apoptosis associated speck like protein( ASC) and pro-caspase-1]. The expression of Toll-like receptor pathway was detected by RT-PCR. The death of 5637 cells induced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli( UPEC) and lactate dehydrogenase( LDH) release were evaluated using live/dead staining. The results showed that in the rat bladder,the expressions of SHH,NLRP3 inflammasomes and Toll-like receptors were significantly up-regulated,and NLRP3 inflammasomes were significantly activated by UPEC infection. The administration with PSV could significantly increase the concentration of IL-10 in urine,inhibit the expressions of SHH,NLRP3 inflammasomes and Toll-like receptors in bladder,and inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. A large number of 5637 cells were dead after UPEC infection and caused LDH production. PSV could significantly inhibit the death of 5637 cells and the release of LDH.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of extracts of Leonuri herba on the contraction of the isolated rat aorta. Although the H20-extract (0.3-3 mg/ml) by itself showed a limited effect, the extract enhanced phenylephrine-induced contraction of the aorta with endothelium, but not without endothelium. The H20-extract, like N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase), significantly inhibited the relaxation induced by acetylcholine in the aorta with endothelium. The inhibitory effect of H20-extract on the relaxation decreased by co-addition with 1 mM L-arginine. The vasoconstrictive effect of H20-extract was not due to leonurine, which is a constituent in Leonuri herba and shows uterotonic activity. Intravenous injection of the H20-extract (1.5 mg/kg) to rats caused an increase in blood pressure for 5 min, like L-NAME (1.35 mg/kg).

The search for medicines that affect the differentiation and function of osteoclasts is crucial in developing therapies for osteoclast-based diseases. Vaccaria hypaphorine, the main active compound of the traditionally used Chinese herb Vaccaria segetalis, has anti-inflammatory activity. The present study demonstrated for the first time that vaccaria hypaphorine could significantly inhibit the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastic differentiation in vitro and alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone loss in vivo. Further study showed that vaccaria hypaphorine decreased osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, vaccaria hypaphorine was confirmed to inhibit osteoclasts differentiation at early stage but not at later stage. Pit formation assay and F-actin ring staining showed that vaccaria hypaphorine inhibited the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Mechanistically, vaccaria hypaphorine impaired RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through reduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation.

Crude polysaccharides and the aqueous extract from the seeds of V. segetalis (SVCP) were proved to be effective on treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to test the effects of SVCP on urinary tract infection (UTI) induced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strain CFT073 in the rat model and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat UTI model was established with the infection of UPEC strain CFT073. After oral administration of SVCP, the urinalysis and histological examination were evaluated. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, procalcitonin (PCT) and polymeric Ig receptor (PIGR) were used to test the effects of SVCP on host immunity. The mRNA level of PapG in CFT073 was used to test the influence of SVCP on virulence factor. The effects of SVCP on the inhibition of bacterial adhesion were evaluated with mice UTI model. RESULTS: In the rat UTI model, the levels of bacterial load, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) in urine and the pathological injury in the bladder were significantly up-regulated, the expression of PIGR in kidney was down-regulated, no significant change was observed on the pro-inflammatory cytokines in urine. After oral administration of SVCP for 3 days, the levels of bacterial load, WBC and RBC in urine were significantly decreased, the pathological injury in the bladder were remarkably inhibited. The expression of IL-6, IL-8 in urine and PIGR in kidney were significantly up-regulated by SVCP (200 mg/kg). SVCP showed no effect on the concentration of PCT in serum. SVCP failed to down-regulate the mRNA level of PapG in CFT073. In the mice UTI model, pre-treatment of SVCP failed to inhibit the intracellular bacterial load in the bladder.

The aim of this study was to explore whether leonurine is able to inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) malignancy. Here, we found that leonurine dose dependently inhibited the proliferation, migration, colony formation and promoted apoptosis of CML cells. Furthermore, leonurine markedly reduced CML xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanically, leonurine upregulated SOCS5 expression, thus leading JAK2/STAT3 signaling suppression. Silencing of SOCS5 by its siRNA abrogated the effect of leonurine on CML cells, demonstrating that SOCS5 mediates the anti-leukemia effect of leonurine. Notably, we observed that miR-18a-5p was remarkably increased in CML cells. Treating CML cells with leonurine significantly decreased miR-18a-5p expression. Moreover, we found miR-18a-5p repressed SOCS5 by directly targeting its 3'-UTR. miR-18a-5p downregulation induced by leonurine reduced the biological activity of CML cells by relieving miR-18a-5p repression of SOCS5 expression.

This study aimed to screen the antilipolytic fraction from SMW and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms on hepatic insulin resistance. Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKα knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis.
